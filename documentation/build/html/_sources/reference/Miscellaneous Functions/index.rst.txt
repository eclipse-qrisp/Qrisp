Miscellaneous Functions
=======================

This section contains the documentation of several functions that don't belong into any of the previous categories.

* :doc:`Gate application functions` provides a list of available functions for (elementary) gate application.

* :doc:`Prefix arithmetic` documents the functions that underly the infix arithmetic methods of QuantumFloat. These can come in handy when uncomputing, as many of those permit the specification of a target to calculate the result into.

* :doc:`Grover tools` treats some functions that enhance the construction of Grover oracles and their evaluation using Grover's algorithm.

* :doc:`Utilities` contains some functions that help with general management tasks.
