    "# Baby’s first Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "With a solid foundation in mathematics and physics, we are now ready to\n",
    "embark on our journey into the world of quantum computing. We will start\n",
    "with some theoretical considerations, as well as study and use the\n",
    "fundamental quantum operations. In the last section we will discuss\n",
    "today’s challenges to reliable quantum computers. To make it more\n",
    "interactive and practical, we sprinkled some qrisp code into the\n",
    "sections to help you get familiar with the coding style.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DiVincenzos Criteria for Quantum Computers\n",
    "\n",
    "But as always, we need to start with some theory. In 1996, the\n",
    "theoretical physicist David P. DiVincenzo proposed five requirements for\n",
    "the realization of quantum computing hardware that still hold today:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. **Scalability** Microscopic quantum objects, which can be precisely\n",
    "controlled, form the building block of quantum computers. The discrete\n",
    "energy levels in atoms (think of the Bohr model introduced before) or polarization\n",
    "states of photons are used to physically implement the basis states. A\n",
    "quantum computer needs the ability to scale the qubit count reliably\n",
    "without decoherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. **Initialization** The qubits need to be initialized accurately to\n",
    "perform computations. The basis states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ are\n",
    "frequently used, but other linear independent states are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. **Coherence** Coherence describes the time a qubit maintains its\n",
    "quantum properties before it follows the rules of classical mechanics\n",
    "and is useless for quantum computations (decoherence). To avoid\n",
    "decoherence, isolation from outer influences is necessary, but still\n",
    "maintaining accessible to implement the gate operation and measurements.\n",
    "This poses as one of the biggest challenges today. For effective\n",
    "computations, a long coherence time is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. **Universality** Quantum gates are the core elements of quantum\n",
    "computing, similar to the logic gates of classical computing. To build a\n",
    "universal quantum computer, you need a universal gate set. These gates,\n",
    "when combined in various ways, are able to approximate or simulate any\n",
    "other quantum gate; which means you can construct any quantum operation\n",
    "or gate you might need using this set of gates. We will study a basic\n",
    "universal quantum gate set down below.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. **Measurement** Quantum states need to be observed (measured) at the\n",
    "end of the algorithm to obtain classical information that we can\n",
    "interpret. For this purpose, every qubit needs to be accurately\n",
    "measured, which leads to decoherence. Therefore, a qubit can only be\n",
    "observed once, else the computation has to be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Qrisp\n",
    "\n",
    "Qrisp is a high-level language to write programs for quantum computers.\n",
    "Much like in classical high-level languages like Python or C++, the main\n",
    "objects we’re working with in Qrisp are variables and functions instead\n",
    "of single qubits and gate operations. This means that you don’t have to\n",
    "study quantum mechanics for several years to program a quantum computer.\n",
    "In fact, the tutorial sections you have read so far are a very good\n",
    "starting point to dive into programming quantum computers with Qrisp.\n",
    "Let’s look at the structures you already know from classical computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main object we’re working with in Qrisp is the **QuantumVariable**,\n",
    "which acts like any other variable. It is assigned with a number\n",

    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we put so much effort into developing a new programming\n",
    "paradigm is the promised quatum advantage. This describes the hope that\n",
    "a quantum computer can solve problems that no classical computer can\n",
    "solve in feasible time. This advantage has not been proven so far, but\n",
    "we have evidence to believe in it, such as clever engineered algorithms\n",
    "that make use of quantum phenomena and can already solve specific\n",
    "problems faster (that we will look at in the next sections).  \n",
    "However, there are still challenges we face before quantum advantage is\n",
    "reached. In this section we will go through some major challenges\n",
    "physicists and engineers are facing when building quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the **connectivity** between qubits plays a vital role. When\n",
    "two qubits need to be adressed together, e.g. with a CNOT gate, but are\n",
    "not connected to each other, the qubits need to be permuted via SWAP\n",
    "operations which costs valuable computation time and thus increases the\n",
    "probability of quantum noise effects (errors). However, a well-connected\n",
    "qubit system can lead to unwanted qubit interactions, termed as\n",
    "cross-talk between qubits, which induce decoherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum systems are extremly fragile and prone to **decoherence**. The\n",
    "slightest change in temperature, humidity, electromagnetic influences\n",
    "(even in another room) or even the qubits themselves as just established\n",
    "can lead to information loss. Of course, these challenges are kept in\n",
    "mind when designing the hardware, but it is still hard to completely\n",
    "isolate the qubits from the evironment, especially since we need to\n",
    "manipulate them via gate functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar, decoherence limits the **scalability**, as bigger quantum\n",
    "circuits offer more chances to induce noise. A higher qubit count\n",
    "however is needed to tackle interesting problems that are\n",
    "computationally too expensive on classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These effects often prohibit as many qubit connections as mathematically\n",
    "or physically possible, or require additional qubits for error\n",
    "correction. This leads to the logical qubit to physical qubit trade-off.\n",
    "You can therefore often only implement algorithms using fewer logical\n",
    "qubits than available physical qubits. This relationship is estimated to\n",
    "be 10:1 to 1.000:1, depending on the algorithm, the error correction\n",
    "method and the fault-tolerance of the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually be able to build elaborate quantum computers and hopefully\n",
    "achieve quantum advantage, error handling techniques arised, so we can\n",
    "reduce these effects. In the section error handling (comming soon), we\n",
    "have a closer look at different techniques. You can now decide if yo\n",
