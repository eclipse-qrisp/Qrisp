    "# Fundamental Physics \n",

    "To get a maximum coherence time of your quantum understanding, we will go over some necessary quantum mechanics concepts to build a foundation on all phenomena quantum computing uses. Most will be explained at a fundamental level, so you can understand it even if you have no physics background. However, we recommend to have read the math introduction before. \n",

    "## Quantum? I hardly know her \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the most pressing question: What is a quantum, anyway? A quantum refers to the smallest discrete quantity involved in an interaction.   \n",
    "To understand that definition better, have a look at Einstein's photoelectric effect: He discovered that light isn't a continuous stream or wave, but instead made up from little packages, the photons. The outer photoelectric effect appears when electromagnetic beams strike a dense object and electrons break out. To simplify: Light shines at a metal and electrons bounce off the metal. \n",
    "However, this effect only starts to occur at a certain frequency (that frequency is connected to the colour) of the light. Below that threshold, no electrons are emitted, no matter the intensity (brightness) of the light. Furthermore, frequency is the only variable affecting the emmission rate: Intensity plays no role, counter-intuitive to classical mechanics. From this result, Einstein concluded that light is \"chunky\" and its energy is defined by $E = h\\nu$. Energy can only be absorbed or transmitted in disctrete steps, multiples of $h$ (Planck's constant). The particles of light, called photons, are the quantum pieces of light. To summarize: Photons with a distinct energy hit electrons in metal, transmit their energy and if the frequency $\\nu$ exceeds the metal-specific threshold, the electron is emitted (that minimum energy is metal-specific). \n",
    "\n",
    "The photoelectric effect belongs in the bigger picture of the experiments conducted at that time, including the double-slit experiment. It states that light is a wave and that would predict that no such threshold should exist.   \n",
    "Originally conducted with electrons, the double-slit experiment shows that particles like electrons (and light, as we know now) show a wave-like interference pattern when sent through a double slit. To conduct the experiment, singular electrons where shot at a wall with two distinct slits. The electrons would be marked behind the wall.\n",

    "While you might expect a simple addition of two Gaussian curves  behind each slit (if you think of electrons as \"balls\"), the experiment showed an interference pattern with its highest peak at the middle between the slits. This is characteristic for a wave, but not discrete particles.  \n",
    "The only explanation that makes both experiments work: small objects (think electrons, photons...) are both a particle and a wave simultaneously. This particle-wave-duality was one of the key realizations to start the field of quantum physics. "

    "## Postulates of Quantum Mechanics \n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the perfect connection to the postulates of quantum mechanics, breaking the concepts down to their essence: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Every physical system can be described as its wavefunction $\\psi$.** Yes, this includes all physical systems, so technically, you can be described as your statefunction. However, for large systems (like humans), the quantum properties are so small they can be ignored, hence why classical mechanics even is a thing.\n",
    " **The probability of a particle being in the place $(x, y, z)$ at the time $t$ can be calculated by $\\mid \\psi(x, y, z, t) \\mid ^2$.** Since the wavefunction is complex, $\\mid \\psi(x, y, z, t) \\mid ^2 = \\psi (x, y, z, t) \\psi  ^* (x, y, z, t)$. Every wavefunction exists in a complex vector space with inner product (a Hilbert space) known as the state space of the system. The system is completely described by\n",
    "its state vector, which is a unit vector in the system’s state space. $\\ket{0}$ is called the ground state, as it represents the least energy. Other states, such as $\\ket{1}$ or $\\ket{2}$, are called excited and require energy to put a particle into them. For quantum computing, we only consider two states, that we call $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The state space of a composite physical system is the tensor product of the state spaces of the component physical systems.** Moreover, if we have systems numbered 1 through $n$, and system\n",
    "number $i$ is prepared in the state $\\ket{\\psi_i}$, then the joint state of the total system is $\\ket{\\psi} = \\ket{\\psi_1} \\otimes \\ket{\\psi_2} \\otimes ...\\ket{\\psi_i} \\otimes... \\ket{\\psi_n}= \\ket{\\psi_1\\psi_2...\\psi_i ...\\psi_n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The time dependence of a quantum system is given in Schrödinger's equation** $i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = \\hat{H}\\psi$. $\\hat{H}$ is the operator of the Hamiltonian function $H = T +V$, usually describing the energy of a system. This is barely relevant for quantum computing, so we can skip over the details. (If you want to understand Quantum Variational Eigensolvers, having a closer look would be useful, but that is a journey for another day). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Every observable has a corresponding operator $\\hat{A}$.** This operator is linear:\n",
    "$\\hat{A} (\\alpha \\ket{\\psi} + \\beta\\ket{\\phi}) = (\\alpha \\hat{A} \\ket{\\psi}) + (\\beta \\hat{A} \\ket{\\phi})$, to represent the change in the statevector, which is a linear combination of the basis vectors, and hermitian. \n",
    "While the wavefunction describes the state of a system, the observables are something to be extracted from it, like a measurement. Operators are mathematical functions to represent these observables, that can act on the state vector to extract information about the observable properties of the system. The state vector of a system changes after applying an operator on it: $\\hat{A} \\ket{\\psi} = \\ket{\\phi}$, while staying in the same Hilbert space. Operators are non-commutative. Since they are hermitian and don't commute, matrices are a natural choice to represent them.   \n",
    "Why do they need to be hermitian? Usually, a non-hermitian operator that holds $\\hat{A}\\ket{\\psi} = \\ket{\\phi}$ would not satisfy $\\bra{\\psi}\\hat{A}  = \\bra{\\phi}$, but $\\bra{\\psi} \\hat{A}^\\dagger= \\bra{\\phi}$ does. Considering that the bra is the complex conjugate and transpose of the ket, this connection hold up for hermitian vectors $\\hat{A} = \\hat{A}^\\dagger$.  \n",
    " **Upon measuring an observable $A$, the measured value is one of the eigenvalues of $\\hat{A}$.** If you repeat the measurement, a statistical mean can be calculated. That is found by $\\left\\langle \\psi \\middle| A \\middle| \\psi \\right\\rangle =  \\int \\psi ^* \\hat{A} \\psi dV$. After measurement, the state of the system collapses to $\\frac{A \\ket{\\psi}}{\\sqrt{\\bra{\\psi}A ^\\dagger A \\ket{\\psi}}}$. "

    "## Superposition \n",
    "\n",
    "In classical mechanics, a particle can be described by its position and momentum at any given time. We might not always know these properties, but this is a human problem and not an issue of the physical system. Quantum mechanics, however, introduces the concept of superposition, where a system can exist in mutliple states simultaneously, making it impossible to determine certain attributes.  \n",
    "We already established the  vector $c_1 \\ket{0} + c_2 \\ket{1} = \\ket{\\psi}$, where $\\mid c_1 \\mid ^2$ and $\\mid c_2 \\mid ^2$ show the probabilites of the quantum entitiy to be in the state $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ respectively. Nevertheless, these probabilites should not be interpreted as a sign that the particle is clearly in one of these states, we just don't know which one and therefore have to rely on a statistical probability. Prior to the measurement, the qubit exists in both states at the same time, called superposition, emphasizing the probabilistic nature of quantum machanics.  \n",
    "In our previous introduction to quantum particles, we saw that light behaves as a wave and as a particle, depending on the situation. This behaviour is not forseeable. A photon is therefore in a superposition: $\\ket{photon} = c_1 \\ket{wave} + c_2 \\ket{particle}$(this isn't very mathematical, but I hope it gets the point across). \n",
    "In the double slit experiment, the electrons are in a supersposition of multiple wavefunctions with different wavelengths and frequency, observable by the interference pattern. (This explanation is part of the Copenhagen interpretation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we measure a quantum particle, its superposition collapses. You can imagine that the photon has to \"decide\" on a property, we call this \"deciding\" the collapse of the wave function. In the collapse, the wave function takes u one of the eigenvalues with 100% certainty. In our $\\ket 0$ $\\ket 1$ basis, that is either 0 or 1. If you repeat the same experiment for many times, you can keep a statistic how often the result is 0 or 1. These statistical outcomes determine our coefficients $c_1$ and $c_0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the collapse might sound useful now, it is a bummer in calculations: \n",
    "When you combine multiple qubits, this leads to exponential growth of possible qubits states (mathematically, you can check that with the tensor product we introduced earlier). Unfortunately, the wavefunction collapse takes this away. When you combine 7 qubits, you get $2^7= 128$ dimensions (and possible states). Measurement collapses these down to only 7 classical bits, each one either 0 or 1.   \n",
    "In the real world, atoms don't exist alone in a vacuum. The interactions with other particles can act as a measurement and lead to decoherence, meaning the atom's wavefunction collapses and the superposition is lost. This happens very easily and is an ongoing hardship for efficient quantum hardware.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, superposition is visualized through a linear combination of basis vectors, as seen in the principle of superposition $\\ket \\alpha =\\sum_{x}c_n \\ket{x}$. Basis vectors represent the fundamental states of a quantum system, and any other state of the system can be expressed as a combination of these basis vectors. One example we have used so far is $\\ket{\\psi} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0} +\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{1}$. Here, the state $\\psi$ is expanded as a sum of the eigenstates $\\ket 0$ and $\\ket 1$ of an Hermitian operator (e.g. the Hamiltonian), since the eigenstates of any Hermitian operator form a complete basis. \n",
    "If $x$ isn't discrete (for example the time or position), an integral is calculated instead, with $\\psi(x)$ as the wavefunction: $\\psi(x) = \\int \\ket{x'} \\bra{x'} dx'$.  \n",
    "Most time, we do our calculations in the computational basis, $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$. Apart from that, these is also another popular basis, derived from the Pauli X eigenstates (more on the Pauli matrices in the next chapter):$\\ket{+} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\ket{0} + \\ket{1})$  and $\\ket{-} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\ket{0} - \\ket{1})$. You can calculate the eigenstates for any Hermitian matrix/operator the way we introduced last chapter (TODO: add link). \n",
    "\n",
    "Superposition is hardly a visile physical property, hence why we didn't introduce an experiment to prove it. It is rather a mathematical device: The sum of states is also a state. It also depends on your chose basis vectors: In our usual $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ basis,  $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\ket{0} + \\ket{1})$ is in superposition, but in the $\\ket{-}\\ket{+}$ basis, it is a basis vector. Superposition should be seen as a fundamental mathematical tool, like complex numbers (we won't prove their usefulness either). "

Even when this happens every time I go on vacation (which would indicate a packing problem on my side), I never know which shoe I packed until I open my luggage and look for it, but the moment I see which shoe I packed, I instantly know that the other was left at home, I cannot have the right shoe with me and also have a right shoe at home, they need to complement each other (their outcomes are correlated). However, the exact result (if I have left or right with me) is nondeterministic.  \n",

I can see it is the right one, which would mean that the left one is in the other box. But in fact, my second shoe has gone back into superposition and could now be right or left. This revelation posed a problem for the hidden variable theory, as it should have been predictable and not go back into superposition. \n",

Furthermore, unitary operators conserve probability and stay normalized. To abide to the rules of quantum mechanics, all quantum computing gates also need to be reversible and therefore all matrices we use are unitary. This is a big step away from classical computing and also the reason why we cannot just transfer all classical gates onto a quantum computer (If you don't believe me, try to think of a way to reverse the AND gate with output 0).\n",

    "   + 3: time evolution is guarded by the Schrödinger equation $i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = \\hat{H}\\psi$.\n",
    "   + 4: Every observable has a corresponding linear operator. Upon measurent, the wavefunction collapses to one of the eigenstates. \n",
    "+ A quantum particle can be in multiple states at once, called superposition. The superposition collapses when measured. \n",
    "+ Entanglement defines the strong correlation of two or more quantum particles, where the state of one particle cannot be independently described without the state of the others.\n",
    "+ No-cloning theorem: no singular, unknown qubit can be cloned \n",
    "+ The Bohr atom model gives a simplified insight in the physical implementation of a qubit, with its orbits representing the states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$. The electrons spin can also be used to implement these. \n",
