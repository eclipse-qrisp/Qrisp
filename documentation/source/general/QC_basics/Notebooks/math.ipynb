    "# Mathematical Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully understand and envision the concepts of quantum computing, a\n",
    "solid mathematical foundation is necessary. In this section we want to\n",
    "give you the most important basics in linear algebra, complex numbers\n",
    "and probability theory and also cover on why we need them in quantum\n",
    "computing. If you’re already familiar with the concepts presented here,\n",
    "you can directly go to the next section physics. If you however have\n",
    "the feeling that you need some refreshing of your math skills before\n",
    "starting with this section, you might want to take a look [here for\n",
    "linear algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra). Our\n",
    "main topics cover matrices, vectors, complex numbers and probability. If\n",
    "one of these topics is completely unfamiliar to you, we suggest to study\n",
    "the fundamentals elsewhere and come back. However, all sections should\n",
    "be understandable with a high school degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "## complex numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Since some familiarity with complex numbers is required, we will quickly\n",
    "skim the baiscs. Complex numbers use the imaginary unit $i=\\sqrt -1$ and\n",
    "are written in the form $z= a+bi$. With their real part $a$ and\n",
    "imaginary part $b$, they can be visualized:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./complexplane.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From this plot, we can see that there is also another way to represent\n",
    "complex number: by their polar form $r e^{i \\theta}$. $r$ marks the\n",
    "absolute value and is calculated by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. The angle\n",
    "$\\theta$ is calculated with $\\theta = tan^{-1}(\\frac{b}{a})$. Using\n",
    "Euler’s formular, we can also express complex numbers as\n",
    "$r (cos(\\theta) + i*sin(\\theta))$. This will be useful later on when\n",
    "expaining the Blochsphere, but for now this is all we need. Another\n",
    "property we need is the complex conjugate, that changes the sign before\n",
    "the complex value: $\\overline{z} = a - ib$. Notice that the complex\n",
    "conjugate of a real number stays the same.\n",

    "### Vectors and Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "As we already learned in the first chapter, in quantum computing we are\n",
    "working with qubits. They are the equivalent to classical bits, with the\n",
    "same functionality as the smallest unit, but more values than just 0\n",
    "or 1. They are our basis for basically everything, so we want to start\n",
    "with how we can describe them.  \n",
    "Qubit states are mathematically represented as state vectors. These\n",
    "vectors exist in a complex vector space and we can use the **Dirac\n",
    "notation** to represent them. This specialty of quantum mechanics is\n",
    "also called the braket (yes, I spelled that right). The ket-part\n",
    "represents a column vector and is denoted with a right kink:\n",
    "$\\left (\\begin{array}{c}\\alpha\\\\ \\beta\\\\ \\end{array} \\right)= \\ket{\\psi}$. \n",
    "The corresponding dual vector, a row vector, forms the bra. It looks\n",
    "like a mirrored ket:\n",
    "$\\left (\\begin{array}{c}\\alpha& \\beta\\\\ \\end{array} \\right)= \\bra{\\psi}$.\n",
    "The braket is, and you might have already guessed, the combination of\n",
    "both: $\\bra{\\psi} *\\ket{\\psi}= \\braket{\\psi \\mid \\psi}$. Maybe you have\n",
    "seen the scalar product $\\braket{\\psi, \\phi}$ before, which is\n",
    "mathematically the same thing. Unlike classical bits that can only be 0\n",
    "or 1, quantum state vectors use complex numbers to express probability\n",
    "amplitudes, meaning that the coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in\n",
    "$\\ket{\\psi} = \\alpha \\ket{0} + \\beta \\ket{1}$ are complex numbers.  \n",
    "2-Dimensional vectors consist of two 2 components, similar to our\n",
    "quantum states. It seems logical to use this similarity and use vectors\n",
    "to visualize quantum states. The quantum state $0 \\ket{0} + 1 \\ket{1}$\n",
    "would be represented in the vector\n",
    "$\\vec{v} =\\left (\\begin{array}{c}0 \\\\ 1\\\\ \\end{array} \\right)$. This\n",
    "vector is denoted as $\\ket{1}$, since it has a 100% probability to\n",
    "collapse to 1. Analogous, the state $1 \\ket{0} + 0 \\ket{1}$, also\n",
    "$\\vec{v} =\\left (\\begin{array}{c}1 \\\\ 0\\\\ \\end{array} \\right)$ or just\n",
    "$\\ket{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct calculations, a basis is necessary. You might know the basis\n",
    "of kartesian coordinates, which are just the vectors along the axes:\n",
    "$\\left (\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ \\end{array}\\right)$ and\n",
    "$\\left (\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 1\\\\ \\end{array} \\right)$. Other vectors are\n",
    "possible as a basis, but they need to be orthogonal to each other, that\n",
    "way one vector can’t be represented as a linear combination of the other\n",
    "basis vectors. If you want to describe any vector now, you would do it\n",
    "in regards to the basis and write your vector as a linear combination of\n",
    "the basis vectors. Therefore, you need a basis to know how to express\n",
    "all other vectors, and the same vector has different notations in\n",
    "different bases. Another basis that is often used in quantum mechanics\n",
    "is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{+} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{0} +\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{-} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{0} -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This basis makes sense to use when in superposition, hence when your\n",
    "starting qubits already are in the state $\\ket+$ or $\\ket-$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two states are orthogonal, if\n",
    "$\\braket{\\psi \\mid\\phi}= 0. \\braket{0 \\mid 1}$ Satisfy this equation,\n",
    "hence why we chose them as basis vectors, but so do $\\braket{+ \\mid-}$.\n",
    "We can write every other vector as a linear combination of these two.\n",
    "Other basis vectors can be chosen, and sometimes are, as long as they\n",
    "are linearly independent.  \n",
    "Orthogonality can be used for way more than just finding a basis. It is\n",
    "integral to some algorithms, as explained in later chapters, but can\n",
    "also be utilized for (quantum) machine learning and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### visualization via the Bloch sphere\n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualize the qubit states on the Bloch sphere. It serves as a\n",
    "geometrical representation of the quantum state of a single qubit.\n",
    "Imagine a sphere where each point on the surface corresponds to a unique\n",
    "quantum state. Qubit states can be visualized as points on this sphere,\n",
    "allowing us to comprehend their superposition and entanglement\n",
    "properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image1](./Blochsphere01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ket{0}$ (here blue) and \\|1⟩ (red) denote the basis states, like a\n",
    "north and south pole. Superposition allows qubits to exist in a\n",
    "combination of these basis states, expressed as linear combinations of\n",
    "state vectors. In the introduction, we discovered the state\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{0} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{1}$ for the equal\n",
    "superposition. On the Blochsphere, this vector can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image2](./BlochsphereHadamard.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting state is always the red arrow. The blue or red arrow are\n",
    "given if we apply a Hadamard gate to 0 or 1 and only differ in phase. We\n",
    "will show a calculation later.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the Bloch sphere come to represent quantum states, and how can\n",
    "I find the corresponding spot to any state? Let me show you the\n",
    "calculation. Every complex number, like our coefficients $\\alpha$ and\n",
    "$\\beta$, can be represented in their polar form $re^{i\\phi}$. If we use\n",
    "that to write our amplitudes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_\\alpha e^{i\\phi_\\alpha}\\ket{0} + r_\\beta e^{i\\phi_\\beta}\\ket{1} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "this is equivalent to (by multiplying $e^{-i \\phi_\\alpha}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_\\alpha \\ket{0} + r_\\beta e^{i\\phi_\\beta - \\phi_\\alpha} \\ket{1} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our state vector has to be normalised, we know that\n",
    "$\\mid r_\\alpha \\mid ^2 + \\mid r_\\beta \\mid ^2 =1$ and with trigonometric\n",
    "relations (see the right triangle, $r_\\alpha$ and $r_\\beta$ are now the\n",
    "legs along the axses $\\ket{0}/\\ket{1}$ and $\\ket{+}/\\ket{-}$), we can\n",
    "make both numbers dependent on $\\theta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cos(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\ket{0} + sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) e^{i\\phi} \\ket{1} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\phi_\\beta - \\phi_\\alpha=\\phi$\n",
    "\n",
    "These two angles $\\phi$ and $\\theta$ can now be interpreted as the\n",
    "azimuth and polar angle of a sphere: the Blochsphere. $\\theta$ is\n",
    "associated with the elevation angle, while $\\phi$ is the rotation angle\n",
    "around the z-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "All quantum states that we have considered so far are pure states and\n",
    "can represent them as a complex number or a vector pointing to the\n",
    "surface of the Blochspere. Mixed states on the other hand, usually\n",
    "described by a density operator $\\rho$, are a combination of pure\n",
    "states. The density matrix covers probabilities for the different pure\n",
    "states that mix together and their entanglement, since we don’t have\n",
    "complete knowledge how the mixed state is prepared. In real life, this\n",
    "can happen very easily, since the environment in the lab is not 100%\n",
    "controllable and even small influences can alter our system.  \n",
    "Mixed states are represented by an interior point in the sphere. The\n",
    "purity of a state can be visualized as the degree of closeness to the\n",
    "surface:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image3](./mixed_state.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to get superposition and mixed states confused. To highlight\n",
    "their difference, (equal) superposition\n",
    "$\\ket{\\psi} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{0} +\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{1}$\n",
    "has a 100% chance of being in the state $\\ket{\\psi}$, therefore the\n",
    "superposition is a pure state. In contrast, a mixed state is in one\n",
    "state, but we are not sure which one and can only statistically say\n",
    "which state is likely from the density matrix. An example of a mixed\n",
    "state is\n",
    "$\\ket{\\rho_{mixed}} = \\frac{1}{{2}} \\ket{0} \\bra{0} +\\frac{1}{2} \\ket{1} \\bra{1}$\n",
    ", which has a 50% chance of being in the state $\\ket 0$ and a 50% chance\n",
    "of being in the state $\\ket 1$. We can see that this is not a pure state\n",
    "since the amplitude squares don’t add up to 1, but the coefficients do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### tensor product: multi qubit systems\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have only talked about single-qubits systems, but to do\n",
    "something useful on a quantum computer we need of course more than one!\n",
    "If we want to combine multiple qubits, we will need a special product,\n",
    "called the tensor product $\\otimes$. The same symbol is also sometimes\n",
    "called the Kronecker product and in most cases, these are\n",
    "interchangeable. While the Kronecker product defines the multiplication\n",
    "of matrices, the tensor product is a more general approach and\n",
    "multiplies linear maps. For us, matrices always represent linear maps,\n",
    "so it doesn’t really matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplication of two vectors is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec a \\otimes \\vec b=$ \n",

    "### Matrices and Quantum Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to describe qubit states, also of larger systems,\n",
    "we want to do something with these qubits. And for that we need quantum\n",
    "gates. At their core, all fundamental quantum gates can be represented\n",

    "\n",
    "To have a function (“gate”) act on a qubit, the mathematical formulation\n",

    "When we measure a qubit, infinitely many quantum states\n",
    "undeterministically collapse to one bit (either 0 or 1). The probability\n",

    "Quantum states, such as those of qubits, are akin to Schrödinger’s\n",

    "typically represented as probability vectors. This representation is a\n",
    "consequence of the fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that\n",

    "\n",
    "All vectors we considered so far are probability vectors, meaning that\n",

    "sum up to 100%. In other words, it guarantees that when you measure a\n",
    "quantum system, one of the possible outcomes will indeed occur. It’s a\n",
    "fundamental requirement for quantum states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability amplitudes, denoted by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in our example,\n",

    "the probability amplitudes of these states. It can take any value\n",
    "between $0- 2\\pi$ and it influences the interference of quantum states\n",
    "during measurements. In quantum algorithms, manipulating the relative\n",

    "this case, the phase is $\\theta$. We know that it is a global phase\n",
