    "Now that we had a first look at general rules of quantum computing, we finally stop beating around the bush and introduce Qrisp to you. Qrisp is a high-level quantum programming language, which means that you don't need to deal with the underlying qubit management and can just program away. We highly encourage you to try out the coding examples yourself, to get a good grasp of what Qrisp is about. \n",

    "Most of these structures like floats, the Ascii code and even the quantum gates were not new (at least since last chapter) and some are even very similar to classical computing. The next section will bring you a rather new concept: the quantum oracle. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum Oracle \n",
    "\n",
    "An oracle can be seen as a black box, that takes some input and returns an output, quite similar to classical functions or methods. To make the \"black box\" concept a little more trustworthy, we can define them as a function $f : \\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^m$, meaning that a bitstring of arbitrary length is modified into another bitstring (that can be of a different length). Technically, oracles are allowed to stay black boxes, meaning that we don't need to exactly know what's going on to use them in an algorithm. Practically, you should know what you're implementing.  \n",
    "At many times, the oracle will be unknown and given to you to use as imput for an algorithm. You could imagine the oracle as some locked box you are trying to open via the algorithm to know what's inside. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we should recall the reversibility of all quantum operations and that we therefore use unitary matrices, which obviously also applies to oracles. \n",
    "Because of this, it is unfortunately not possible to define an oracle as $O(\\ket x) = \\ket{f(x)}$, since there technically could be an $\\ket y$ so that $\\ket{f(x)} = \\ket{f(y)}$ and the oracle wouldn't be reversible anymore. We hence need a way to preserve the input $\\ket x$. To do that, we introduce a second register: $O(\\ket{x} \\otimes\\ket{y}) = \\ket{x}  \\otimes \\ket{y \\oplus f(x)}$, with $x \\hspace{0.1 cm}\\epsilon  \\hspace{0.1 cm}\\{0, 1\\}^n$, $y \\hspace{0.1 cm} \\epsilon \\hspace{0.1 cm} \\{0,1\\}^m$ (notice that the registers can be of different size)\n",
    "and $O$ as the oracle with its function $f(x)$. \n",
    "This might look weird now, but when you see an example on $\\ket y = \\ket 0$ it might be clearer:  \n",
    "$U (\\ket x\\ket 0) = \\ket x \\ket{ 0 \\otimes f(x)} = \\ket x \\ket{f(x)}$. Here,  $\\ket y$ acts as an ancilla qubit without much use, but it can also be used to induce phase kickback when $\\ket y = \\ket -$(more on that in the later algorithm).  \n",
    "For further uses, we differentiate between boolean oracles and phase oracles. \n",
    "\n",
    "![oracle](./oracle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **phase oracle** applies a phase onto the input state. Is the input state a computational basis state ( e.g. $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$), it only adds a non-measurable global phase. Is the input state in superposition, we get a relative phase that influences the overall result (TODO: add link). This is why most algorithms use a Hadamard gate to put the concerning qubits into superposition before calling the subroutine.  \n",
    "The general form of a phase oracle of often described as: \n",
    "$O(\\ket x) = (-1)^{f(x)} \\ket x$.  \n",
    "A famous algorithm using a phase oracle is Grover's search algorithm, that we will have a look at in a future chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is a **boolean oracle**, since it doesn't change the phase but returns a truth value. It can be defined as: \n",
    "$O(\\ket{x, 0}) = \\ket{x, f(x)}$, and therefore requires ancilla qubits to store the output. A well known algorithm involving a boolean oracle is the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which we will have a look at now. \n",
    " \n",
    "## Deutsch Jozsa Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we want to actually use these oracles. Most times, their benefit when implemented alone is... arguable, but we can integrate them into a bigger algorithm. Our first oracle, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, is a simple routine to demonstrate the superiority of quantum computing by offering an exponentional speedup compared to possible classical solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the problem solved by Deutsch-Jozsa, we receive a black box oracle, that takes a bitstring of arbitrary length as an input and returns either 0 or 1: $f: \\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$. The output stems from a boolean function $g: \\{0, 1\\} \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$; \n",
    "that is either constant (same output value regardless of input) or balanced (50% output 0, 50% output 1). We don't know anything else about $g$ (hence it is a black box) and our goal is to determine in which category the function belongs. Classically, you would have to send at least two queries, for input value 0 and 1. (If we expand to $N$ possible inputs, we generally need $\\frac{N}{2}+1$ queries). If both are the same, the function is constant, but you couldn't determine that with only one query.  \n",
    "The quantum oracle however has an incredible runtime of $O(1)$, no matter the input size. The secret lies in utilizing the Hadamard gate and an auxiliary qubit. For an input of length 1, we therefore initialize 2 qubits: one in the state $\\ket 0$, the auxiliary qubit in the state $\\ket 1$. We start by using a Hadamard gate to put our query in all possible states at once (I know, we said before quantum computing won't solve all our problems by doing this... let it slide this one time).   \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the black box oracle is applied, taking all qubits as input. The input $\\ket x \\ket y$ (x bitstring, y auxiliary qubit) is transformed to $\\ket x \\ket{ y\\otimes f(x)}$ via the oracle, with $\\otimes$ as addition modulo 2.  \n",
    "Wait, modulo 2? For now,  we don't have to worry about that. This step is ensuring that the only numbers we work with are 0 and 1 (we are staying in a mathematical group, if you are a nerd).  \n",
    "\n",
    "With this initialization, we ensure that phase kickback occurs. By applying the Hadamard gate to the auxiliary qubit in $\\ket 1$, it is transformed to $\\ket -$. Using it now as input to the oracle with the bitstring qubit ensures that phase kickback(TODO: add link) occurs, and the value of $f(x)$ influences the outcome of $\\ket y$. To understand this in depth, let's have a look at the mathematics when the oracle is applied: \n",

    "$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(O((\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket 0 + \\ket 1) \\ket 0) - O((\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket 0 + \\ket 1)\\ket 1))$  \n",
    "Next, we apply the oracle  $O(\\ket x \\ket y)= \\ket x \\ket{y \\otimes f(x)}$:  \n",
    "$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}(\\ket 0 + \\ket 1) \\ket{ 0\\otimes f(x)}) - (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}(\\ket 0 + \\ket 1) \\ket{ 1\\otimes f(x)}))=$\n",

    "\n",
    "What is $f(x)$? The next calculations depend on wether $f(x)$ is constant or balanced. Since every possible solution is different, the output tells us which it is. \n",

Phase kickback alters, as the name suggests, the relative phase, hence the probability amplitudes are not changed and we comply with the rules for an oracle. \n",
