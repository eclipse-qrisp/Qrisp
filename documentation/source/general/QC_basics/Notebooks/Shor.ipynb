Shor's algorithm is quite math-heavy, so we will also go through some number-theory to get a better intuition.

    "## RSA Encryption: Really Safe Algorithm?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with an encryption protocol, which is the reason of Shor's algorithm's relevance. A good chunk of the internet's encryption is done with RSA (named after its inventors Rivesr-Shamir-Adleman), which relies on the factorization of large numbers. When I send you a message, two prime numbers $p$ and $q$ are generated and their product $n$  is calculated. This product is further altered with the Euler-Totient-function $\\phi(n) = (p-1)*(q-1)$, which calculates how many numbers smaller than $n$ are co-prime with it. Next, we are choosing an exponent $e$ that is smaller than and co-prime with $\\phi(n)$. We also choose an decryption exponent $d$, such that $e*d = 1$ $mod$ $\\phi(n)$ ($d$ is therefore the multiplicative inverse of $e$). We now have two different key sets: the public key $(n, e)$ and the private key $(n, d)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to send a message $m$ with these keys, you calculate $m^e$ $mod$ $n = c$ to encrypt your message. The recipient can now decrypt your message with $c^d$ $mod$ $n = m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This whole process is based on the assumption that if you take large enough numbers $p$ and $q$, the calculation for an outsider would take too long and breaking the encryption isn't feasible. This is mostly based on the factorization: When breaking the encryption and reading messages we aren't supposed to read, we need to calculate $d$ out of $n$ and $e$, which are publicly available. How is Shor's algorithm doing this? For that answer, we need to delve deeper into number theory."

    "\n",
    "At its core, Shor's algorithm is concerned with integer factorization, meaning it finds the prime actors of any given integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematical property is helping us with that: If we have two Numbers $A$ and $B$ that are co-prime, the equation $A*A*A*A*A*... = A^p = C*B+1$ holds up. Meaning that if we raise $A$ to an unknown power, this shares a factor with another multiply of $B$ plus 1, or $A^p -1 = C*B = (A^{\\frac{p}{2}}+1)* (A^{\\frac{p}{2}}-1)$. This form looks like our initial problem again, where we search for two factors $C*B = D*E$ with $D= A^{\\frac{p}{2}} +1$ and $E= A^{\\frac{p}{2}} -1$. These numbers now share factors. So with the rule $A^p = C*B+1$, we could transform two numbers that don't share factors into four who do. Notice how the $p$ we need is not specified, so we will look for this instead in Shor's algorithm.   \n",
    "This equation is derived from Euler's modular theorem, stating that if $x$ and $n$ are co-prime, $x^{\\phi(n)} = 1$ $mod$ $n$, which means it's equal to a multiple of $n$ plus 1. In this case, $x=A$ and $n=B$ in our above equation. \n",
    "Because we use modular arithmetic, this problem is periodic. $A^0 = 1$ $mod$ $N$ is a trivial solution, and we are now loking for the period $p$ after which we again get $A^x = 1$ $mod$ $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second quality we will use states that if $r^x = m_1*N+ d$, then $r^{x+p} = m_2 *N + d$, meaning that for any multiple of $p$, the remainder stays the same (with another multiple of $N$). This repeating property will help us identify $p$ later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another (classical) step in Shor's algorithm is Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Utilizing this, we don't need to find a number that is a direct factor of $N$, but they can also share factors. In this routine, you are given two numbers and subtract mutltiples from them the bigger one untill you are left with 0. The last number you subtracted the the greatest common divisor. This has a runtime of $O((log(a*b))^3)$."

    "## The Algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "How can you determine the factors of a ridiculously large number $N$? First, we might as well pick any random number that is smaller than our given one as an initial guess. This will most likely not be or share a factor with $N$, but we can check using the Euclidean algorithm. If we find that $gcd(N, r)=1$, we now transform $r \\rightarrow  r^{\\frac{p}{2}} \\pm 1$ (as per the equation we introduced above), which now might be multiples of our sought out factors (but with Euclid, that also isn't a problem). However, other problems are posed:    \n",
    "$A^{\\frac{p}{2}} +1$ and $A^{\\frac{p}{2}} -1$ might be a multiple of $N$, so the common divisor we would find is $N$ itself and we gain nothing.\n",
    "If $p$ is an odd number, how can we find its half? How can we even find $p$? Finding the power to raise our guess to could take a long time on a classical computer, and this is where we enter the quantumness with interference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As we have explained some time ago in the physics chapter, interference happens if two or more waveforms collide and the waves either add up or cancel each other out into a new pattern. In this case, we want it to cancel out all wrong solutions, so that we are only left with the state that has the correct $p$. How do we do this? We start with our guess $r$ and a random $x$. We raise $r^x$ and put all possible powers into a superposition $\\ket{\\psi_1} = \\ket{x, r^x} + \\ket{x+1, r^{x+1}}+ \\ket{x+2, r^{x+2}}...$. We now want to calculate the remainder $d$ from how much $r^x$ is bigger than $m*N$ to gain $\\ket{\\psi_2}= \\ket{x, d_x} + \\ket{x+1, d_{x+1}}+ \\ket{x+2, d_{x+2}}...$. The next step is to cancel out all states that don't carry $d= 1$ with interference. How can we implement this? \n",
    "\n",
    "After this step, all $x$ in the remaining states are spaced out with period $p$, meaning that we have a frequency of $f= \\frac{1}{p}$. Frequency? This word triggers the entrance of another subroutine we have learned some chapters ago: Quantum Fourier Transformation. This step is central in Quantum Phase Estimation, which is used as a sub-algorithm here. As the name suggests, we estimate a phase, here the period after which $d=1$ get repeated.  \n",
    "With QFT, we calculated the frequency and can invert now to get $p$. Great! Now there's nothing left to do. Well, except check is $p$ is even (and repeat the whole process if it's not), calculate $r^{\\frac{p}{2}} \\pm 1$ and maybe apply Euclid's algorithm again. But now, you can read Trump's e-mails (if you even want that)! \n",

We apply modulo operations and put them into an equal superposition using a Hadamard gate to get the state $\\ket{\\psi_2}= \\ket{x, d_x} + \\ket{x+1, d_{x+1}}+ \\ket{x+2, d_{x+2}}...$. We then find the phase with remainder $d=1$ using IQFT. If our solution is now even, we can transform it to $r^{\\frac{p}{2}}+1$, calculate the $cgd(r^{\\frac{p}{2}}+1, N)$ and we're done!"
