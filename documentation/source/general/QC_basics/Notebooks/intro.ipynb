    "# Learn Quantum Programming with Qrisp\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Qrisp learning module! If you are reading this, you\n",
    "already made a great decision today by starting to learn about quantum\n",
    "computing and choosing Qrisp as your companion. Together, we want to\n",
    "explore the quantum world and how it can be of use for computational\n",
    "tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "With qrisp, we focus on gate based quantum computing, following an\n",
    "agnostic approach, meaning it runs independent of the hardware\n",
    "architecture. The advantage of gate-based computing is its universality\n",
    "and feasibility. Other models, such as annealing or measurement-based\n",
    "computing, also exist and we will have a look at them in a later\n",
    "section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start our journey with this very first chapter and find out why\n",
    "you should spend your time learning about quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Quantum Computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "To not get your hopes too high, I want to start by saying that quantum\n",
    "computers will not take all problems that ever existed and give your the\n",
    "best solution. There are many areas where the use of quantum computers\n",
    "doesn’t make sense, and the general consensus is that you won’t be\n",
    "having a quantum computer in your living room to do your online\n",
    "shopping.  \n",
    "After these (maybe discouraging) words, let’s have a look at some fields\n",
    "that could heavily profit from the use of quantum computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   optimization problems: In a use case study by Volkswagen and D-Wave\n",
    "    Systems, buses for a convention had to be routed through the narrow\n",
    "    streets of Lisbon. Taking the convention times, hotel locations,\n",
    "    street conditions and sightseeing into account, the goal was to\n",
    "    route the buses in the most efficient way to avoid jamming up. 1,275\n",
    "    real-time optimization tasks had to be done to fulfill the actual\n",
    "    constraints, creating new routes every time. \\[1\\] Another\n",
    "    optimization problem poses portfolio optimization for finance. Being\n",
    "    able to handle vast amounts of data and swiftly identify risks and\n",
    "    profits would create a huge advantage. Currently, estimated 10 to 40\n",
    "    billion dollars are lost every year to fraud and faulty data\n",
    "    management. As present fraud detection is highly inaccurate with a\n",
    "    high number of false alarms, quantum technology can revolutionize\n",
    "    customer targeting and prediction modeling by efficiently analyzing\n",
    "    large volumes of behavioral data to offer personalized financial\n",
    "    products and services in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   computational biology and physics: Problems that grow exponentially\n",
    "    on classical computers would only grow linearly on quantum hardware.\n",
    "    One example is the simulation of molecules: The chemical reaction of\n",
    "    three hydrogen atoms is already challenging, even for a\n",
    "    supercomputer. With every added atom, the necessary calculations\n",
    "    double. Now imagine the really interesting stuff like proteins or\n",
    "    cancer cells, absolutely impossible to reliably model today. With\n",
    "    quantum computing, bioinformatics would be on another level.  \n",
    "    It is so obvious it is rarely mentioned: Through quantum computing,\n",
    "    we hope to accurately simulate quantum mechanical systems and gain\n",
    "    more insights into the physics, which is still partly a mystery.\n",
    "    Chemical properties such as ionic bonds (essential in molecule\n",
    "    building) are inherently quantum, and could receive an advantage\n",
    "    being modeled by a quantum device.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   material simulation: The field of material simulation is concerned\n",
    "    with predicting properties to achieve desired outcomes, like\n",
    "    increased absorption or decreased reflectivity. In order to give\n",
    "    precise predictions, the Hamiltonians (energy functions) need to be\n",
    "    solved and therefore the energy of the system is calculated. Taking\n",
    "    the same prequisites in quantum chemistry as computational biology,\n",
    "    quantum computers can be used to model underlying quantum mechanics.\n",
    "    Note that these calculations are already done on classical hardware,\n",
    "    but we could improve the accuracy and model more complex systems in\n",
    "    the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, it is not just some theoretical toy that is cool and\n",
    "interesting to some researchers, but has real-life use cases. In the\n",
    "next chapters, we will back these examples up with theoretical\n",
    "considerations, so stay tuned!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "We already gave some motivation for why quantum computing is interesting\n",
    "and now want to delve a bit deeper in the theory behind that. If you\n",
    "have dabbled in computer science before, you probably came across this\n",

    "which shows the different time complexity classes of algorithms. The\n",
    "algorithms are divided, based on their estimated runtime for a specific\n",
    "input size $n$. Many algorithms that we are interested in have at least\n",
    "quadratic complexity $O(n^2)$ and are therefore restricted when it comes\n",
    "to solving bigger problem instances.  \n",
    "Why should you care about quantum complexity? A popular example is the\n",
    "public-key cryptosystem RSA: This encryption scheme relies on the\n",
    "well-studied assumption that factoring a given number, i.e. finding its\n",
    "two prime factors, scales exponentially with the length of the given\n",
    "number $O(\\sim e^n)$, making the task impossible for large enough\n",
    "numbers. But since 1994 this assumption only holds for classical\n",
    "computers, because Peter Shor then presented an algorithm for quantum\n",
    "computers, which only has a polynomial time complexity\n",
    "$O(\\sim (\\log n)^2).$ This means that with a big enough quantum computer\n",
    "it would be possible to break current public-key cryptosystems, by\n",
    "exploiting quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement and\n",
    "interference. In the section physics, we will learn about these\n",
    "phenoma and how they make quantum advantage possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to emphasize here, that quantum computers aren’t just\n",
    "“faster” than classical computers, but due to their entirely different\n",
    "nature, there are certain problems for which quantum computers need\n",
    "considerably less operations to calculate the result, thus making it\n",
    "possible to solve problems that are intractable with classical\n",
    "computers, even though the operations themselves might be slower. This\n",
    "is why we develop entirely new algorithms for quantum computers instead\n",
    "of merely running the already existing programs, recognizing they aren’t\n",
    "these supermachines and operate fundamentally different.\n",

    "## Complexity Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "If the examples we’ve shown you so far didn’t convince you enough to\n",
    "start learning about quantum computing, the next part surely will: We\n",
    "will now take a look at the even bigger picture of complexity classes.\n",
    "Two very well-known classes are P and NP with the major unsolved “P\n",
    "versus NP” problem. Both classes simulate a Turing machine in polynomial\n",
    "time, deterministic (P) or nondeterministic (NP) (you can imagine a\n",
    "Turing machine like a mathematical model of a very basic computer).\n",
    "Furthermore, the class BPP contains all problems that can be solved on a\n",
    "Turing Machine in polynomial time in a probabilistic manner. In this\n",
    "context, we cannot guarantee the right solution every time, but we\n",
    "demand at least $\\frac{2}{3}$ of all answers to be correct (BPP=\n",
    "bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time). Similarly, the complexity\n",
    "class BQP (bounded-error quantum polynomial time) solves a problem on a\n",
    "quantum computer in polynomial time, up to an error of $\\frac{1}{3}$ (we\n",
    "will talk more about the error rate of quantum computers in the chapter\n",
    "“error handling”). Both classes contain the same error rates, but\n",
    "simulate the problem on different machines.  \n",
    "Shor’s algorithm for factoring is suspected to be in BQP, but not BPP,\n",
    "meaning we can simulate the algorithm in polynomial time on a quantum\n",
    "computer, but (likely) not on a classical computer like a Turing\n",
    "machine. It is assumed that multiple problems lay in BQP, but not BPP,\n",
    "making quantum algorithms attractive for us.\n",

    "computer, but only requires $n$ queries on a quantum computer.  \n",
    "Nevertheless, many complexity relations are still not entirely proven,\n",

    "Classical computers work with bits, the smallest unit of information,\n",

    "information the system can store and process grows linearly. Similar to\n",
    "classical computers, quantum computers work with qubits, whose states we\n",
    "write as $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$.  \n",
    "Given their quantum nature, they can also be in a\n",
    "superposition of 0 and 1. What does that mean? You can\n",
    "imagine that a qubit can be in two states at once, 0 and 1\n",
    "simultaneously. When combining qubits together, we get exponential\n",
    "growth $2^n$ instead of linear growth. Because of superposition, the\n",
    "qubits can be in all possible states $2^n$ at the same time. This means\n",
    "that $n$ qubits are equivalent to $2^{n}$ bits.\n",
