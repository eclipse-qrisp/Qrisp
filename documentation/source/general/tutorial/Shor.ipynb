    "# Factoring integers using Shor's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of quantum computing, where classical limitations are challenged and new horizons are explored, Shor's Algorithm stands as a testament to the transformative potential of quantum mechanics in the field of cryptography. Developed by mathematician Peter Shor in 1994, this groundbreaking algorithm has the power to revolutionize the world of cryptography by efficiently factoring large numbers, once considered an insurmountable task - at least for classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, Shor's Algorithm addresses one of the cornerstones of modern asymmetric encryption: the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Many cryptographic protocols, including the widely used RSA algorithm, rely on the presumed computational complexity of this task to secure sensitive information. However, Shor's Algorithm exploits the unique properties of quantum computing to perform this factorization exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to demystify the intricacies of Shor's Algorithm by leveraging the programming abstractions that Qrisp provides to boil down the algorithm to only a few lines of code. Please note that this tutorial is not meant to teach the number-theoretical details, but is focussed on how the algorithm can be implemented and compiled. For an in-depth look, please consider the following resources:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$U_x \\ket{y} = \\ket{(xy) \\text{mod} N}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "that is, $U_x$ performs an in-place modular multiplication with $x$ on any quantum number $\\ket{y}$.\n",

    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might know by now, the reason why this algorithm can be tricky to implement is because the operator $U_x$ is non-trivial to encode as a quantum circuit and a variety of ideas have been proposed in the past. A popular way of constructing this circuit is to start with a regular in-place adder, build a modular adder from that, build an out-of-place modular multiplyer from that, and finally combine two out-of-place multiplyers into one modular in-place multiplyer. If this wasn't already complicated enough, you also need the controlled version of this circuit. The [approach that we are using here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01081) might also be complicated but the Qrisp abstractions allow for a powerfull reduction in complexity for the user, while still retaining a degree of flexibility for customization and most importantly, PERFORMANCE. 🚀\n",
