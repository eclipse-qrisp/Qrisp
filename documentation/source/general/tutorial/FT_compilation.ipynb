    "# Fault-Tolerant compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "As quantum computing [steadily progresses towards the era of fault-tolerant quantum processors](https://www.quera.com/press-releases/harvard-quera-mit-and-the-nist-university-of-maryland-usher-in-new-era-of-quantum-computing-by-performing-complex-error-corrected-quantum-algorithms-on-48-logical-qubits), the landscape of compilation techniques undergoes a profound transformation. While Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have been the pioneers in demonstrating quantum computational capabilities, the vision for practical quantum computing hinges on fault-tolerant architectures capable of handling errors that naturally arise in quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial delves into the realm of compiling for fault-tolerant quantum devices, exploring the specialized techniques and considerations that set this stage apart from the compilation challenges encountered in NISQ environments. In the quest for fault tolerance, quantum error correction becomes a paramount concern, demanding innovative strategies to mitigate errors and maintain the integrity of quantum computations over extended periods.\n",

    "One of the major differences in compiling for FT devices is the fact that CNOT gates are no longer the bottleneck they used to be for NISQ devices. The new bottleneck is the execution of $T$-gates since these gates require [distillation of magic states](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.020341) and subsequent teleportation into the quantum computer. Qrisp provides a variety of tools to optimize the amount of T-gates as well as their depth."

Well first of all, the `jones` method requires two ancilla qubits - this news isn't as bad as it seems, because the Qrisp compiler automatically reuses the qubits from previously deallocated variables, so in many practical situations the qubit overhead is 0. The other important point is that this Toffoli technique uses a mid-circuit measurement with a subsequent classically controlled CZ-gate. For more details, visit the [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5069). Note that the measurement is not inserted until the `compile` method is called - before that, a representative is used. This allows to still query the `statevector` simulator (even though the final circuit contains a measurement) and thus significantly simplifies debugging. Note that you can activate/deactivate the compilation of mid-circuit measurements using the `compile_mcm` keyword.\n",

    "The second relevant Toffoli method is `gidney`. [Gidney's temporary logical AND](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06648) always comes im pairs - one computation and one uncomputation.

This is because the computation part (similar to `jones`) has a T-depth of 1 (asterisk!)\n",

    "If you made it this far, you probably heard about the quantum fourier transform algorithm and it's circuit. This circuit contains a variety of parametrized phase gates, which can throttle the efficiency of a fault-tolerant backend as they have to be synthesized using T-gates. Fortunately a lot of this overhead can be remedied with a trick introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07739). The observation here is that the QFT circuit contains repeated blocks of phase gates of the following structure."
