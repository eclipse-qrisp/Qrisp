    "## Sudoku\n",
    "\n",
    "Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game that gained widespread popularity in the late 20th century. Its name, \"Sudoku,\" originates from the Japanese words \"su\" (meaning \"number\") and \"doku\" (meaning \"single\"). The puzzle consists of a grid typically composed of nine rows, nine columns, and nine smaller subgrids known as \"regions\" or \"blocks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of Sudoku is simple: fill in the grid so that each row, column, and region contains the numbers 1 through 9, with no repetition. A partially completed grid is provided, with some numbers already filled in. The challenge lies in using deductive reasoning and logic to determine the correct placement of numbers within the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sudoku puzzles come in various difficulty levels, ranging from easy to extremely challenging, based on the number and placement of initial clues provided. While the rules remain consistent, the complexity of solving the puzzle increases with fewer initial clues and the necessity for more advanced solving strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, Sudoku has evolved into a beloved pastime for enthusiasts of all ages, offering a stimulating mental exercise that promotes concentration, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Whether played casually in newspapers, puzzle books, or digital platforms, Sudoku continues to captivate individuals worldwide with its timeless appeal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will be working with 4x4 Sudoku mostly because we want to keep the results still simulable. A 9x9 or even 16x16 implementation would of course work equally well.\n",

    "\n",
    "As they fall into the category of constraint satisfaction problems, Sudokus are (in a quantum sense) usually tackled using Grover's algorithm (SPOILER ALERT: we won't be using that approach). In this case constructing the oracle is rather straight forward, if the circuits for evaluating numerical comparisons are available. This, however, comes with the drawback that the state space of the search grows exponentially, which the quadratic speed-up of the Grover search barely mitigates. Of course there are much better ways of solving a Sudoku than just trying out every single combination; the same also holds true for the quantum realm. In this tutorial you will learn how a strategy called *backtracking* can be used to utilize the problem structure to gain a performance advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking approaches encopass a large class of algorithms, which are usually specified by both an `accept` and `reject` function. Furthermore, a set of possible assignments to an array of fixed length is also required. For a more detailed introduction consider [this page](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-backtracking-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/) or [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking). In general, the algorithm in Python code usually boils down to:"

    "However, there is a caveat for practical reasons: While Montanaro suggests that the algorithm should never explore rejected nodes, in our implementation rejected nodes are explored but have no children. As described above, we need to pick the depth to be $n = k + 1$ where $k$ is the number of empty fields in the Sudoku board. Otherwise, i.e., if $n = k$, the sibling nodes of the solution might be rejected. Because of this fact, the algorithm will still explore them and evaluate `accept` to `True` (because they have height 0), leading to the ambiguous situation that a node returns `True` for both `reject` and `accept`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `reject` function is more complicated because this function needs to consider the Sudoku board and check whether all the assignments are in compliance with the rules of Sudoku. Another layer of complexity is introduced by the fact that the `reject` function should only consider entries that have already been assigned. To keep our presentation comprehensive, we will first implement a function, which checks a fully assigned Sudoku board and then modify this function such that it can also ignore non-assigned values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping to a graph-coloring problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To check the compliance of a fully assigned Sudoku board (encoded in `branch_qa`), the first step is to transform it into a graph-coloring problem. This implies that we represent each entry of the Sudoku board (given or assigned) as a node of an undirected graph $G$. The rules of Sudoku (columns, rows, and squares containing only distinct entries) are then included by adding an edge to $G$ for each comparison that needs to be performed to assert distinctness of the elements."

    "\n",
    "As this is a backtracking implementation, our Sudoku compliance check also has to understand that the results of certain comparisons should be ignored, since the corresponding fields are not assigned yet. For example, consider a Sudoku field with 4 empty fields, where only one field has been assigned so far. In our implementation of the algorithm, the empty fields are encoded as zeros in `branch_qa` and we only know that they are not assigned yet by considering the height QuantumVariable. The implementation of the Sudoku-check algorithm given above would therefore return \"not valid\" for almost every single node, because it assumes that the 3 remaining empty fields carry the value 0 even though in reality they have not been assigned yet. Because of that we need to also take the value of the height variable `h` into consideration, describing the height of the node in the QuantumBacktrackingTree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the one-hot encoding of this variable makes this rather easy: The value that has been assigned most recently is indicated by the corresponding qubit in `h` being in the $\\ket{1}$ state. For example, in a tree of maximum depth 5, if the `branch_qa` entry with height 3 has been assigned recently, `h` will be in the state $000100$. The next assignment would then be height 2, i.e. $001000$.\n",
    "For a quantum-classical comparison with the `branch_qa` entry $i$, we can therefore simply call the comparison evaluation controlled on the $i$-th qubit in `h`. This implies that this comparison can only result in `True`, and as a result cause the `reject` value to be `True` if $i$ was assigned most recently.\n",

Otherwise, the precision of the phase estimation has to be increased. To make the result still simulable on a laptop, we will decrease the amount of empty fields to 3. If you want to try higher more empty fields, we recommend using the Qiskit Aer MPS simulator.
