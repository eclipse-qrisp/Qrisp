    "# Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "While the previous examples contained a complexity, that could in principle still be managed with a low level QuantumCircuit creation framework, our next problem contains much more conceptual complexity. We believe that this example clearly displays the neccessity of a higher-level language like Qrisp in order to tackle problems of similar or even higher complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is a common example of an NP-hard problem. The task is to find the shortest round trip through a set of cities, which are described by a weighted graph. As shown in [this tutorial](https://qiskit.org/documentation/optimization/tutorials/06_examples_max_cut_and_tsp.html) the traveling salesman problem can be reformulated in terms of a [QUBO problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization) instance and then solved using either VQE or QAOA. A certain disadvantage of this approach is that the amount of binary variables grows as $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ where $n$ is the amount of cities.\n",
    "Another approach has been demonstrated [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10928.pdf) (which has also been implemented in a [Qiskit tutorial](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-paper-implementations/tsp.html)). The idea is to use quantum phase estimation on successive diagonal operators to retrieve the route distance. The amount of qubits here grows as $\\mathcal{O}(n log(n))$. Unfortunately the paper provides no details on how to perform the actual quantum search.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now introduce a solution that resembles the second method including the quantum search. This involves creating a superposition of all possible routes (excluding those that repeat cities), assessing the distance of the routes, and determining whether the distance is below a certain threshold. The use of Qrisp's high-level language features simplifies many of these steps. Moreover, employing Qrisp not only streamlines the process, but also greatly improves resource efficiency: The presented code includes more than 10 distinct QuantumVariables distributed across 41 qubits which compiles into a QuantumCircuit that uses only 23 qubits."

    "## Setting up a superposition of all routes\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Qiskit's solution, we will not search the space of **every** combination of cities but only the permutations (ie. the combinations, which contain each city only once). To do this we need to set up a superposition, where only the permutations are present. We achieve this by bringing a set of QuantumVariables $s_0, s_1, .. s_k$, which we call ``perm_specifiers`` into uniform superposition. Each computational basis-state of these variables specifies a permutation. We then call a function ``eval_perm``, which creates a [QuantumArray](../../reference/Core/QuantumArray.rst) containing that permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_{\\text{eval perm}} \\sum_{s_0 = 0}^n \\sum_{s_1 = 0}^n \\dotsc \\sum_{s_k = 0}^n \\left( \\bigotimes_{i = 0}^k \\ket{s_i} \\right) \\ket{0}\\\\\n",

    "   \n",
    "The first task in creating the oracle is therefore to code the function ``eval_perm``. The idea here is to use \"reverse\" [selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort). What does that mean? A sorting algorithm is basically a procedure that reverts every permutation to its ordered state. The reversal of this procedure therefore transforms the ordered state (ie. (1,2,3..)) to a permutation, based on a set of variables. For selection sort this set of variables is the index of the minimum element of each iteration. This index specifies, which element is swapped to the first position. Swapping a QuantumArray entry specified by a [QuantumFloat](../../reference/Quantum%20Types/QuantumFloat.rst) to the first position can be achieved by inverting the [demux](../../reference/Primitives/demux.rst) function:"

    "Here, ``trip_distance`` is a QuantumFloat which contains the distance between the i-th city and its successor. This QuantumFloat then gets added to the result and afterwards uncomputed. The uncomputation allows the qubit manager to reuse the qubits of ``trip_distance`` after each iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The keyword ``recompute = True`` is a bit more involved: Since this function will be embedded into an oracle, the result will be uncomputed at some later point. There are now two ways to deal with the uncomputation of the ``trip_distance`` QuantumVariables inside the uncomputation of the ``res`` QuantumVariable.\n",

    "> * Delay the uncomputation of ``trip_distance`` such that the information can be used to uncompute ``res``.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Recompute ``trip_distance`` and use the recomputed value for the uncomputation of ``res``.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> There is pros and cons for both strategies. By default the underlying algorithm of Qrisp's automatic uncomputation will always go for option 1. The main drawback of this approach is that delaying the uncomputation blocks the involved qubits for the time of the delay. This implies that the qubits of the ``trip_distance`` QuantumFloat from each iteration will be blocked, which is not the behavior we want. Much rather we would like to reuse the qubits of iteration 0 for iteration 1 and so on. Because of this, we set ``recompute = True`` which will perform the uncomputation immediately and automatically recompute if needed at a later point. All of this might seem complicated but simply setting ``recompute = True`` is enough - the rest is handled by the compiler. Once you reach the end of the tutorial, we invite you to compare the qubit count when setting this keyword to ``False``!\n",
