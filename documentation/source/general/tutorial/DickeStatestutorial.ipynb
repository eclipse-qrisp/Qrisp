    "# Preparation of Dicke States\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show you different routines for the preparation of Dicke States and how to implement them in Qrisp! They are all [JASP](../../reference/Jasp/index.rst) compatible, so you can seamlessly integrate them into your realtime computations as a subroutine. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two main approaches we will look at are [an efficient deterministic algorithm by Jeffery Yu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03428) , and [a deterministic algorithm by Bärtschi et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07358), as well as the  [more efficient version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12435) of the latter.   \n",
    "\n",
    "But before we jump into their preparation, let us first answer the questions: **What are Dicke states? And what do we use them for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition and utility of Dicke States\n",
    "\n",
    "The preparation of Dicke states is an important and highly investigated topic in the field of quantum computation due to to their range of applications. \n",
    "This ranges from error correction techniques in the ISD algorithm to optimization tasks solved with [DQI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08292) or [QAOA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10555). \n",
    "Furthermore, these states are native to quantum optics systems due to their relation to spin systems, \n",
    "and can be found in quantum communication applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, Dicke states are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dicke states are characterized by there constant Hamming-weight. A Dicke state with $n$ qubits and Hamming-weight $\\text{wt}(x)=k$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\ket{D_{k}^{n}} = \\binom{n}{k}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\sum_{x \\in \\{ 0,1 \\}^{\\otimes n},  \\text{wt} ( x ) = k  } \\ket{x} $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An example for this is the Dicke state $\\ket{D_{2}^{4}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} ( \\ket{1100} + \\ket{1010} + \\ket{1001} +\\ket{0110} + \\ket{0101} + \\ket{0011} )$, consisting of 4 qubits with Hamming-weight $wt(x)=2$.  \n",
    "It can also be defined in direct relation to a spin system, see p.e. the [related wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicke_state).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "After the short overview on their definition and applications, let's now dive into the established algorithms for Dicke state preparation! \n",
    "We will start with the probablistic which offers a cool physics-inspired solution! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Probablistic approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The first algorithm we want to highlight here is [Efficient preparation of Dicke states (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03428) by Jeffery Yu et al., from the University of Maryland. \n",
    "The algorithm utilizes mid-circuit Hamming-weight measurements and feedback to prepare Dicke states by incorporating adaptively-chosen global rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../_static/dicke_pseudo_algo.png\" class=\"align-center\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Dicke state pseudo algorithm\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the algorithm is to prepare a Dicke state $\\ket{j, m_t}$ for a desired target value of $m_t$ , starting from the initial product state $\\ket{j, j} = \\ket{0}^{\\otimes n}$.\n",
    "One starts by performing a uniform rotation $e^{-i\\theta J_Y}$ for some angle $\\theta$ and measuring $J_Z$, the eigenvalue in the Pauli Z-basis.\n",
    "If $m = m_t$ is measured, the procedure ends. Otherwise, we iterate, choosing subsequent rotation angles $\\theta$ based on the prior outcome of the measurement of $J_Z$.\n",
    "The rotation angles $\\theta$ are chosen to maximize the overlap of the current state with the target Dicke state on each iteration.\n",
    "The pseudocode for these iterations is shown in the figure above.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../_static/dicke_rotations.png\" class=\"align-center\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Dicke state rotations\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The angle $\\theta_{m_t, m}$ is chosen such that it maximizes the overlap of the Husimi–Q distributions (for more information refer to the paper) of the rotated state and the target Dicke state in the limit of large $j$.\n",
    "We reach this maximum when the corresponding ring distributions intersect at a point where they share the same tangent vector, as shown in the figure above.\n",
    "With this condition, we can derive the rotation angle to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\theta_{m_t, m} = \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{m_r \\cdot m_t - m_t \\cdot r_m}{r_0^2} \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper further explains how the collective Hamming weight measurements may be directly implemented on an ensemble of $n$ atomic qubits, in which one of the two qubit states is coupled to a single-mode cavity.\n",
    "In conclusion, we arrive at an algorithm for preparing Dicke states with depth and width logarithmic in the number of qubits, using only sequences of global single-qubit rotations and collective native Hamming weight measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation \n",
    "\n",
    "For the implementation, we will resort back to circuit representation of the aforementioned components, namely the Hamming-weight measurements and the rotations around the Bloch sphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the paper, one of the facilitators for this algorithm is the collective Hamming-weight measurement, so let us start by creating that. \n",
    "It is taken from a [paper on Shallow Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06052) and gives a straight forward \n",
    "scheme. We first create the necessary amount of ancilla qubits, and then apply the routine based on controlled rotations and an inverse [Quantum Fourier transformation](../../reference/Primitives/QFT.rst)."

    "We stop once we measure the correct Hamming-weight. \n",

This jaspified version of a quantum while-loop requires a condition function ``cond_fun()`` with a ``bool`` (or [QuantumBool](../../reference/Quantum%20Types/QuantumBool.rst)) return, and a body function ``body_fun()``.\n",
