    "# Filtered state preparation with GQSP\n",
    "\n",
    "Ground state preparation is a fundamental task in quantum computation, serving as a cornerstone for simulating strongly correlated systems in chemistry, material sciences and physics.\n",
    "Understanding the ground state, i.e., the state of lowest energy, is essential for predicting a system's stability, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity.\n",
    "At the macroscopic level, the behavior of most materials at low temperatures is governed by their ground state configuration. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In Chemistry: The ground state determines the equilibrium geometry of molecules. Knowing this energy level allows us to calculate reaction rates and understand how catalysts lower the energy barriers for specific processes.\n",
    "-   In Material Science: Key phenomena such as superconductivity and magnetism are emergent properties of the ground state in many-body systems.\n",
    "-   In Physics: Identifying the ground state of a Hamiltonian like the Heisenberg model reveals whether a material will behave as an insulator, a metal, or a more exotic phase of matter, such as a quantum spin liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, finding the ground state is a notoriously difficult challenge. In fact, ground state preparation is QMA-complete, meaning it is generally hard even for quantum computers to find the exact solution for any arbitrary Hamiltonian. In practice, we often circumvent this complexity by starting with a 'good enough' initial guess (a trial state) and employing quantum algorithms, e.g., [Gluza et al.](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/rw81-k8vk), to systematically lower the system's energy, a process often referred to as algorithmic cooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explore how to use [Generalized Quantum Signal Processing](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/pdf/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.020368) for this task:\n",
    "starting from an initial system state for a Heisenberg model, we apply a Gaussian filter to enhance the overlap of the prepared state with the ground state.\n",

    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrated how Quantum Signal Processing can be leveraged for ground state preparation. \n",
    "By applying a Gaussian filter to a Heisenberg model, we showcased how eigenstate filtering can systematically enhance the overlap with the target state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Versatility of Block-Encodings:** How Qrisp’s abstraction allows us to embed non-unitary operators, like our Heisenberg Hamiltonian, into quantum programs.\n",
    "-   **Algorithmic Flexibility:** GQSP allows us to implement polynomial transformations, turning abstract mathematical filters into executable quantum programs.\n",
    "-   **Scalability:** While we analyzed the spectrum classically for verification, the methods discussed here provide a scalable path towards exploring complex quantum systems that are beyond the reach of classical simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a next step, you might explore how different filter shapes (such as step functions for excited state isolation) or more complex Hamiltonians impact the performance of the algorithm.\n",
    "For those interested in how these filtering techniques can be utilized to enhance other algorithms, we recommend exploring the work of Lee et al. (2025) on [Filtered Quantum Phase Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04294), which further investigates the utility of spectral filters in the context of phase estimation.\n"
