    "of a Hamiltonian $H$ (acting on a Hilbert space $\\mathcal H_s$) is a pair of unitaries $(U,G)$, \n",
    "where $U$ is the block encoding unitary acting on $\\mathcal H_a\\otimes H_s$ (for some auxiliary Hilbert space $\\mathcal H_a$), \n",
    "and $G$ prepares the block encoding state $\\ket{G}_a=G\\ket{0}_a$ in the auxiliary variable such that $(\\bra{G}_a\\otimes\\mathbb I_s)U(\\ket{G_a}\\otimes\\mathbb I_s)=H$.\n",
    "Here $\\mathbb I_s$ denotes the identity acting on $\\mathcal H_s$.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ U\\ket{G}_a\\ket{\\psi}_s = \\ket{G}_a H\\ket{\\psi}_s + \\sqrt{1-\\|H\\ket{\\psi}\\|^2}\\ket{G_{\\psi}^{\\perp}}_{as},\\quad U= \\begin{pmatrix}H & *\\\\* & * \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",

    "Therefore, a block-encoding embeds a not necessarily unitary operator $H$ as a block into a larger unitary operator $U$. In standard form i.e., when $\\ket{G}_a=G\\ket{0}_a$\n",
