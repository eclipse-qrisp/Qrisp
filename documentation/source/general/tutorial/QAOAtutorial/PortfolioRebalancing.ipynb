    "# Portfolio rebalancing with constrained mixers\n",
    "In this tutorial we will explain how solve discrete portfolio rebalancing problems within the scope of the [Alternating Operator Ansatz](/reference/AOA).\n",
    "\n",
    "Portofolio rebalancing is well studied and widely applicable problem in the world of financial mathematics. Possible quantum algorithms for improvements have been investigated in the last years. Within Qrisp we have created the infrastructure to employ the findings in a straight forward manner!\n",
    "\n",
    "The most relevant research for this tutorial can be found in [Portfolio rebalancing experiments using the\n",
    "Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05296.pdf) by M. Hudson et. al. This paper sets the baseline for translating the portofolio rebalancing optimization problem into the QAOA structure. We will give an outline of the mathematical intrecacies in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the paper [Grover Mixers for QAOA: Shifting Complexity\n",
    "from Mixer Design to State Preparation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00354.pdf) by A. Baertschi et. al. introduces the notion of using constrained mixers, limiting the state subspace to only feasible states, i.e. allowed portfolios. This is achieved using the algorithm from [Deterministic Preparation of Dicke States](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07358.pdf) by A. Baertschi et. al. We will also cover this novel approach in our tutorial, as it is already embedded in our infrastructure.\n",

    "For additional info on problem emergence, real world applications and details on the construction of the optimization problem, we refer to the [paper by M. Hudson et. al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05296.pdf). Including it here is out scope for the implementation and application on quantum frameworks, which we want to focus on in this tutorial. We will therefore only guide you through the steps of translating the mathematical description to code, which can be solved with QAOA."

    "## The Quantum Portfolio rebalancing formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Attention!}$ Do not confuse things here! Our original binary variables are described by $\\textbf{z}$, and the spin operators are referred to by $s^{-}_i$/ $s^{+}_i$ (+ and - exponents are explained below) going forward. In the literature spin operators are usually referred to as $Z$, given that they are $Z$ gates on the hardware. This is not the case in this piece of literature, and we decided to go with the literature formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a given number of assets on which can we invest in short and/or long positions. We store this info in a ``QuantumArray`` of two ``QuantumVariables`` of length $N$, i.e. the number of assets. The short postions are stored in the ``QuantumArray`` -index ``0`` and the long postions are stored in the ``QuantumArray`` -index ``1``. A ``1`` on index ``3`` on ``QuantumArray`` -index ``1`` then means we have long position on asset 4 (arrays are ``0``-indexed). This ``QuantumArray`` is therefore our quantum argument on which we run the the QAOA optimization on to find it in the the state of the optimial solution afterwards. You should be familiar with this concept from other QAOA problem instances in Qrisp. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we go from the classical formulation above to the quantum formulation? In the well know Ising model fashion we first convert the binary variables $\\textbf{z}$ to spin variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use two different spin operators: $s^{+}_i$, which only operates on the $\\textbf{long}$ postion $i$, and $s^{-}_i$, which only operates on the $\\textbf{short}$ postion $i$. They therefore operate on the two different indices of the ``QuantumArray`` argument: \n",
    "\n",
    "$s^{-}_i$ operates on the short postions in the ``QuantumArray`` -index ``0`` and $s^{+}_i$ operates on the long postions in the ``QuantumArray`` -index ``1``\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary variables then turn into \n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_i  = \\frac{s^{+}_i - s^{-}_i}{2},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can plug this into the equations above to receive\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_{RR}(\\textbf{s}) = \\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{i=j}^N \\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{4} (s^{+}_i s^{+}_j  ) - (1 - \\lambda) \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mu_i z_i ,$$\n",

    "\n",
    "With these two equations we can represent the full cost Hamitonian as $H_C = C_{RR}(\\textbf{s}) + C_{TC}(\\textbf{s})$.

    "## Constrained Mixer\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, [the paper by A. Baertschi et. al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00354.pdf) introduces the notion of preparing an allowed state as an initial starting value and then using a constrained mixer to reduce the search space to only feasible states. This fits perfectly into our established infrastructure!\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore start by creating a properly weighted intitial state. A clear description on the conditions here are given in the paper above in page 9 onwards. So, instead of copying the text you can find there word for word, we will refer to this paper here. The two important terms here are *lots* and *bands*. The number of *lots* $d$, is the net total of long minus short positions in the portfolio, and determines the feasible subspace in this context.\n",
    "The solution state for a portfolio with 4 assets, that is defined via the number of lots being 1, can have \n",
    "\n",
    "* 4 ones in the long, 3 ones in the short position ``QuantumVariable`` s of the QuantumArray, i.e. a state such as $\\ket{0111}\\ket{1111}$\n",
    "* 3 ones in the long, 2 ones in the short position, i.e. a state such as $\\ket{0011}\\ket{0111}$\n",
    "* 2 ones in the long, 1 ones in the short position, i.e. a state such as $\\ket{0001}\\ket{0011}$\n",
    "* 1 one in the long, 0 ones in the short position, i.e. a state such as $\\ket{0000}\\ket{0001}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The *band* refers to the number of short positions held.\n",
    "Now, any permutation within the short and long postions, that still contain the correct number of ones (i.e. for the first example state $\\ket{1110}\\ket{1111}$) is also a valid solution, and part of *band* 3. This resembles the subspace of Dicke states, which we aim to prepare with our mixer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therfore start by a correctly weighted superposition with one state from each band, and turn this superposition into a superposition of **all** allowed states with a Dicke mixer."
