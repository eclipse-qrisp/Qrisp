    "## Constraints in QAOA\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world applications of combinatorial optimization often come with a variety of constraints. One of the most prominent use-cases of QAOA is portfolio optimization. In this problem, a set of binary decision variables $x = (x_0, .. x_N)$ is given, indicating whether a certain stock should be in the portfolio. The goal is to find the vector $x$ which minimizes the following quantity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(x) = qx^T \\Sigma x - \\mu x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where\n",
    "\n",
    "* $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^N$ are the decision variables.\n",
    "* $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ specifies the expected returns of each stock.\n",
    "* $\\Sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ is the covariance matrix of the stocks.\n",
    "* $ q > 0$ is the risk aversion parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally (and this is the important point), the problem also comes with a constaint: The investor only has finite funds, which has to be respected by the solution. This constraint is expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1^T x = B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we usually incorporate these constrains in QAOA? Since QAOA is an approximate optimization algorithm, in theory it suffices to modify the cost function such that the forbidden states are high-cost solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{C}(x) = C(x) + \\lambda g(x)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Where $g(x) = 1$ if $x$ is forbidden by the constraints and $0$ otherwise. This approach however comes with several disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compared to a classical algorithm, the quantum algorithm has a much larger search space because it also has to search through the forbidden states.\n",
    "* It is not clear how to choose $\\lambda$. This parameter needs to be big enough, such that forbidden states are effectively suppressed but small enough such that the hardware precision can still \"resolve\" the contrast in the actual cost function.\n",
    "* Forbidden states have a non-zero probability of appearing as a solution, reducing the overall effciency of the algorithm."

    "## Constrained Mixers\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting approach to overcome these problems is the introduction of constrained mixers. These mixers don't mix the states between the allowed and forbidden subspace. In other words: If you insert an allowed state, your are guaranteed to also receive an allowed state after the mixer has been applied. Since QAOA is an alternating sequence of cost function applications (which don't mix the computational basis at all) and mixers, the final state will also be an allowed state (provided that the initial state was allowed).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first example was the [XY mixer](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3149526.3149530), that you might already be familiar with from the Max-$\\kappa$-Colorable Subgraph QAOA Implementation. This mixer could be seen as some kind of \"continuous swap\" operation. That is: In any given multi qubit state, it preserves the number of ones. This is especcially usefull in the context of one-hot encoded [QuantumVariables](../../../reference/Core/QuantumVariable.rst) because this encoding relies on the fact that each state only contains a single one.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more flexible framework has been presented in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06095). The approach here is to classically construct a matrix $H$, which preserves the required subspace and subsequently use Trotterization to simulate evolution under $H$ on the quantum computer. While this approach in principle allows arbitrary constraints, it also has a few disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trotterization is computationally extremely expensive compared to established mixers.\n",
    "* Due to finite Trotterization precision, there can be leakage into the forbidden subspace.\n",
    "* All constraints need to be evaluated classically for all possible states to build up $H$.\n",

    "## Physical intuition behind multi-channel mixers\n",
    "\n",
    "As the mathematical description might be a bit absract, this section is intended to provide some intuition to what multi-channel mixers do. For this we want to emphasize the conceptual relationship between the [multi-slit experiment](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/mulslidi.html#c4) and alternating operator algorithms like QAOA. Why are these ideas related? The phase separator $\\text{exp}(i\\gamma C)$ can be interpreted as a wall of slits, applying a phase of $\\text{exp}(i \\gamma C(x))$ to the slit $x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![all_to_all](all_to_all.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The slits sent out light beams that are brought to interference with the beams of other slits on a screen on the other side of the setup. The process of bringing multiple beams to interfer with each other can be interpreted as the mixer. The analogy goes even deeper: If we move the screen very close to the slits, the horizontal beams will have a signficantly shorter path compared to the other beams and thus experience less radial intensity decay. A close screen therefore corresponds to a mixer with very small $\\beta$, which performs almost no mixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the picture above, we see all-to-all mixing. As mentioned, when implemented on a quantum computer, this requires an all-to-all entangling circuit, which can be computationally expensive. A channelled mixer remedies this flaw by only performing mixing within certain subspaces (here $\\text{span}(\\{\\ket{0}, \\ket{1}, \\ket{2}, \\ket{3} \\})$ and $\\text{span}(\\{\\ket{4}, \\ket{5}, \\ket{6}, \\ket{7}\\})$ - we therefore have two mixing channels).\n",
