    "# QUBO as a QAOAProblem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you'll be guided through the process of defining a new phase separator to be used within the scope of the [Alternating Operator Ansatz](/reference/AOA) focussed on solving various QUBO problems with only needing the QUBO matrix $Q$ as an input.\n",
    "QUBO, or [Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization), is a type of problem that involves optimizing a quadratic function of binary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "After first translating the QUBO Hamiltonian $H_C$ from the binary basis $x_i$​ to the state basis with the translation $x_i\\rightarrow \\frac{\\mathbb{I}-Z_i}{2}$, we'll construct the phase separator unitary and run QAOA to solve the set partitioning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not to get too ahead of ourselves with how to do it, let's first show how to solve a QUBO problem using Qrisp. To obtain the optimal solutions to a problem, we only need to know the QUBO matrix $Q$. In order to get familiar with that, we propose having a look at the [Tutorial on Formulating and Using QUBO Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11538), which explains how to derive such a matrix $Q$. \n",
    "\n",
    "One can then simply minimize the cost function $\\min C(x)=\\min x^TQx$ for binary variables $x_i\\in\\{0,1\\}$. This is done either by sending the QUBO matrix $Q$ to the annealer/quantum computer, which calculates and returns the bitstrings with corresponding values of $C(x)$. The lower the $C(x)$, the better the solution. In other words, we want to find the Hamiltonian $H_C|x\\rangle=C(x)|x\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's borrow the QUBO matrix (explained in depth in the above mentioned [tutorial](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11538)) for the set partitioning problem. The QUBO matrix in that case is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q = \\begin{pmatrix}-17&10&10&10&0&20\\\\10&-18&10&10&10&20\\\\10&10&-29&10&20&20\\\\10&10&10&-19&10&10\\\\0&10&20&10&-17&10\\\\20&20&20&10&10&-28\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, QUBO matrices are upper triangular (by convention) - this means that only elements above the diagonal (with the diagonal included) are not equal to zero. This is because the variables in QUBO problems are binary, which results in the identity $q_iq_j=q_jq_i$ for binary variables. Because of this, the elements above the diagonal are doubled compared to the symmetrized version of $Q$ we wrote down above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course it's easy to go from the conventional QUBO $Q_{\\text{up}\\Delta}$ formulation to the symmetrized $Q_\\text{sym}$ QUBO: $Q_\\text{sym}=\\frac{1}{2}\\big(Q_{\\text{up}\\Delta}+Q_{\\text{up}\\Delta}^T\\big)$, and back:"
