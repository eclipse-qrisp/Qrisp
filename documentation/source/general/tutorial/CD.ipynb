    "# Counterdiabatic Driving Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of counterdiabatic driving (CD) is to evolve an initial quantum state $\\ket{\\Psi_i} =\\ket{\\Psi(t=0)}$ over time, without creating transitions to other higher exited states. This way, the state evolves into a target state after some time $T$: $\\ket{\\Psi_f} =\\ket{\\Psi(t=T)}$. This process, called adiabatic driving, is useful when we know how to create the groundstate but are interested in a state that the system evolves into. One example for a CD application is solving QUBOs, to which we will come later in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will introduce the core concept of couterdiabatic driving and explain the dirving protocols LCD (local counterdiabatic driving) and [COLD (counterdiabatic optimized local driving)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.010312). Then we will show how to run those algorithms in Qrisp by solving a QUBO problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The concept of counterdiabatic driving\n",
    "\n",
    "To drive a system adiabatically, we must meet the adiabatic condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\max_{n, m} \\left[ \\max_{\\lambda} \\bigg| \\frac{\n",
    "    \\hbar \\dot{\\lambda} \\bra{m(\\lambda)} \\partial_{\\lambda} H(\\lambda) \\ket{n(\\lambda)}}\n",
    "    {(E_m(\\lambda) - E_n(\\lambda))^2} \\bigg| \\right] \\ll 1, m \\neq n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $H$ is the driven system hamiltonian, $\\ket{m}, \\ket{n}$ are the time-dependent eigenstates of the system and $\\lambda(t) \\in \\left[0, 1\\right]$ is our scheduling function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adiabatic condition roughly tells us that in order to avoid transitions to exited states we must drive the system slow compared to the size of the energetic gaps $E_m - E_n$. Unfortunately, we cannot push this evolution time too strongly as this leads to quantum incoherences and disruption through noise.\n",
    "Therefore we want to mitigate the diabatic transitions so that we can drive the system adiabatically while keeping the evolution time short.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how diabatic transitions can be mitigated, we need to introduce the adiabatic gauge potential $A_{\\lambda}$. This is a hermitian operator whose diagonal elements desribe the *adiabatic-*  and its off-diagonal elements describe the *non-adiabatic* dynamics of the driven system. It is related to the state evolution in the instantaneous eigenbasis (denoted by $\\sim$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ i \\hbar \\frac{d\\ket{\\tilde{\\Psi}}}{dt} = \\left( \\tilde{H} - \\dot{\\lambda} A_{\\lambda} \\right) \\ket{\\tilde{\\Psi}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind counterdiabatic driving is to add a term to the hamiltonian that **counteracts the diabatic transitions** (hence the name). It turns out that this can be done by adding the negation of the AGP!\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H_{CD}(\\lambda) = H(\\lambda) + \\dot{\\lambda} A_{\\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the exact calculation of the AGP becomes impossible very fast, we need to approximate $A_{\\lambda}$. This is the goal of local counterdiabatic driving (LCD) and counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local counterdiabatic driving (LCD)\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of LCD is to approximate the AGP through local manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A_{\\lambda} = \\sum_j \\alpha_j (\\lambda) \\mathcal{O}_{LCD}^{(j)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator basis $\\mathcal{O}_{LCD}$ should be purely imaginary for a real system hamiltonian [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1619826114). So, a common choice are the pauli $y$ matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{O}_{LCD} = \\sum_i \\alpha_i \\sigma_y^{i}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients $\\alpha_j$ can be calculated by minimizing an action $S$ associated with the AGP:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S(A_{\\lambda}) = \\mathrm{Tr} \\{ G_{\\lambda}^2(A_{\\lambda}) \\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $G_{\\lambda}$ is an operator that is the negation of the generalised force operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G_{\\lambda}(A_{\\lambda}) = \\partial_{\\lambda} H + \\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\left[ A_{\\lambda}, H \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly speaking, the action $S$ measures how close our operator is to the actual AGP of the system. For the derivation and physical meaning of the operators, we refer to [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.010312).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD)\n",
    "\n",
    "We arrive at the core idea of COLD (counterdiabatic optimized local driving) by combining the LCD approach with the study of quantum optimal control theory. While LCD uses a restricted operator basis to find a CD protocol that minimizes the action $S$, COLD introduces another term that aims to find the optimal path $\\ket{\\Psi_i} \\rightarrow \\ket{\\Psi_f}$ such that diabatic transitions are avoided. The optimization objective can be chosen depending on the nature of the physical system.\n",
    "One possible control hamiltonian consists of $z$-pulses weighted by pulses of harmonics:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(\\lambda, \\beta) \\mathcal{O}_{opt} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N_{opt}} \\beta_k \\sin(\\pi k g(\\lambda)) \\sum_i \\sigma_z^{i}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the function $g(\\lambda)$ is the inverse function of $\\lambda(t)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find optimal parameters $\\beta_k$, one has to choose an optimization objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective strongly depends on the nature of the driven system as well as the information and tools avaiable. If the desired final state is known, a sensible objective would be the state fidelity. Another approach is to minimize the coefficients of the AGP at higher orders. Here the idea is that a minimal AGP norm will minimize the non-adiabatic effects along the path in time [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.010312). In the case of QUBO problems, one can also choose the minimization of the cost hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following paragraph we will show two objectives for solving QUBO problems with COLD. But before that, let us quickly discuss how COLD and counterdiabatic driving are connected."

    "# QUBO problems as CD instances\n",

    "A QUBO probelem is a combinatorical optimization problem that can be formulated as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{min} \\ y = x^T Q x, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Q$ is a symmetric matrix and $x$ are binary vectors $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This optimization problem can be encoded into a spin-glass hamiltonian such that the expectation value $\\bra{x}H_p\\ket{x}$ is equal to $y$. Thus, finding the groundstate of $H_p$ leads to the solution of the QUBO problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we will use counterdiabatic driving to reach the groundstate of $H_p$. We prepare our qubits in a well-defined ground state of another initial hamiltonian $H_i$ and then drive it adiabatically to end up in the groundstate of our problem hamiltonian $H_p$.
