    "This snippet compiles a 50 bit (non-modular) multiplication circuit using Qiskit and also takes approximately 20 seconds. Using classical compilation infrastructure, a classical 64 bit multiplication can be compiled within micro-seconds, which hints at the large disparity in compilation speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-time computations\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the compilation scaling issues, many frameworks (Qrisp included) suffer from the inability to integrate classical real-time computations. What is a real-time computation? A classical computation that happens during the quantum computation, while the quantum computer stays in superposition. This computation has to happen much faster than the coherence time, so performing that computation by waiting for the Python interpreter is impossible. Real-time computations are essential for many techniques in error correction, such as [syndrom decoding](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/2900/2/THESIS.pdf) or [magic state distillation](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.020341). On the algorithmic level, real-time computations also become more popular since they are so much cheaper than the quantum equivalent. Examples are [Gidney's adder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06648) or repeat until success protocols like [HHL](https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3171).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Qiskit, real-time computations are in principle achievable by preparing a look-up table using the [c_if](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.Instruction#c_if) feature. Next to the clunkiness there are however scalability questions: For an error correction code that can extract $2^{100}$ possible syndroms, a single round of error correction would require a look-up table with $2^{100}$ entries, which is clearly not feasible. The [OpenQASM 3 specification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14722) elaborates the importance of real-time computations and defines the ``extern`` keyword. So far however neither Qiskit nor the OpenQASM demonstrate how the ``extern`` keyword can be used for executing classically established functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more promising approach is the [QIR specification](https://www.qir-alliance.org/) which integrates quantum related data-types into the widely used [LLVM IR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM). Compiling QIR not only has the advantage of incorporating a wide ecosystem of classically established code but also leveraging highly optimized compilation libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Jasp, we therefore aim to tackle both problems - compilation speed and lack of real-time computations - by targeting the established LLVM toolchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally we want you to keep all your Qrisp code the same and simply enable the Jasp.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Does this make \"regular\" Qrisp old news? Absolutely not! \n",
    ">\n",
    "> As with many Pythonic ``jit`` compilation approaches, a vitally important feature is to execute the code in non-jitted mode for development/maintainance. This is because code introspection is much harder in ``jit`` mode since it is difficult to investigate intermediate results for bug-fixing purposes. The same applies to Jasp: Most Jasp and Qrisp code is interoperable, such that it is very easy to identify bugs using Qrisp mode. The relationship between the two compilation pipelines is therefore:\n",

    "> | **Qrisp** | **Jasp** |\n",
    "> |---|---|\n",
    "> | Development | Scalability |\n",
    "> | Maintainance | Compilation performance |\n",
    "> | Fast prototyping | Real-time computation embedding |\n",

    "### What is Jax?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how to fully leverage the Jasp module, you need a basic understanding of [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/thinking_in_jax.html). Jax is a framework developed by Google, which aims to address a similar set of problems as described above but in the context of machine learning. Essentially Jax makes Python code for ML applications run faster, by leveraging a mechanism called tracing. Tracing means that instead of executing a Python function with actual values, Jax sends so called Tracers through the function, which keep a \"record\" of what would have happened to the values. This record is a mini functional programming language called [Jaxpr](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jaxpr.html). Creating a Jaxprs can be achieved by calling the ``make_jaxpr`` function."

For classical values, we can use the Python native ``isinstance`` check for the ``jax.core.Tracer`` class, whether a variable is dynamic.

For that we create a simple binary classifier and train it on dummy data (disclaimer: ML code by ChatGPT). This is code is not really useful in anyway and the classifier is classifying random data, but it shows how such an algorithm can be constructed and evaluated."

While the programming model of Jasp might differ in some ways from what you are used to with regular Qrisp, we believe that some of presented features will be of vital importance for making large scale quantum computing a reality from software side. If you haven't already done so, check out the [documentation](../../reference/Jasp/index.rst) for more structured information to get your first Jasp algorithm up and running!"
