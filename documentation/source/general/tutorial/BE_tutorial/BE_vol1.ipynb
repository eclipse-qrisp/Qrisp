    "In classical computer science, we often perform operations directly on matrices, such as inversion, exponentiation, or polynomial transformations. In quantum computing, however, all physical operations must be strictly unitary (represented by matrices $U$ such that $U^\\dagger U = I$). This means they must be perfectly reversible and preserve the norm of the state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "For closed quantum systems, this isn't an issue: the system evolves via the complex exponential of its Hamiltonian ($e^{-iHt}$), which is inherently unitary. However, we frequently encounter scenarios where we must implement non-unitary operators on quantum hardware. Common motivations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithmic Approximations: When simulating dynamics, expanding the exponential $e^{-iHt}$ (via Taylor series or Suzuki-Trotter expansions) and truncating it at a specific order leaves you with a non-unitary polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open Quantum Systems: When a quantum system interacts with an external environment, its effective Hamiltonian becomes non-Hermitian, meaning its evolution operator is no longer unitary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Algebra Tasks: Algorithms that solve linear systems of equations (like HHL) require applying inherently non-unitary functions, such as matrix inversion ($A^{-1}$), directly to an operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, modern quantum algorithms use block encodings to \"embed\" these non-unitary matrices into a larger, higher-dimensional unitary system. Once embedded, we can use Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and its generalizations to manipulate the operator and apply arbitrary functional transformations.\n",

In the standard [Copenhagen interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation), this measurement is a non-unitary, non-reversible collapse that triggers the measurement problem—the philosophical and physical gap between smooth unitary evolution and the random nature of observation. While some (including myself) find the [Everettian (Many-Worlds) view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) compelling; where the measurement is just a further unitary entanglement of the observer with the system, it remains a non-standard stance (for now...). Regardless of your preferred interpretation, the practical reality of current hardware requires us to treat measurement as a distinct, non-unitary step that defines the success of our block encoding.\n",

    "## What are block-encodings?\n",
    "Block encoding is a foundational technique that allows a quantum computer to represent a general matrix $A$ (where $\\|A\\|\\leq1$) as the top-left block of a larger unitary matrix $U$.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Because a unitary matrix $U$ always has a spectral norm of $\\|U\\| = 1$, any sub-block within it must also have a norm $\\leq 1$. Therefore, to encode a general matrix $A$, we must scale it by a factor $\\alpha$ such that $\\|A/\\alpha\\| \\leq 1$.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the standard definition (see [Lin Lin, Chapter 8](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08309)), we say that a unitary $U$ is an $(\\alpha, m, \\epsilon)$-block-encoding of $A$ if\n",
    "$$\\| A - \\alpha (\\bra{G} \\otimes I) U (\\ket{G} \\otimes I) \\| \\leq \\epsilon,$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ (Scaling Factor): Since $\\|U\\|=1$, we must scale $A$ such that $\\|A/\\alpha\\| \\leq 1$. Usually, $\\alpha$ is related to the 1-norm of the coefficients in an LCU decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $m$ (Ancilla Qubits): The number of additional qubits required to define the larger Hilbert space in which $U$ acts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\epsilon$ (Precision): The error tolerance. In practice, our quantum circuit $U$ only approximates $A$ to a certain degree of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\ket{G}$ (Signal State): Often called the \"ancilla state,\" this is a specific basis state (typically $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes m}$) that defines the subspace where $A$ is embedded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, we essentially put a scaled, non-unitary matrix in the top-left block of a larger unitary matrix:\n",
    "$$U = \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{A}{\\alpha} & * \\\\ * & * \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "By preparing the ancillas in state $\\ket{G}$ and then projecting back onto $\\bra{G}$ after applying $U$, we \"isolate\" the action of $A$ on our target system.\n",

    "In Qrisp, we can construct a block encoding in four ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [.from_array](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/from_array.rst) constructs a BlockEncoding from a numpy array,\n",
    "\n",
    "- [.from_operator](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/from_operator.rst) constructs a Blockencoding directly from a Hamiltonian constructed via QubitOperators, or FermionicOperators,\n",
    "\n",
    "- [.from_lcu](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/from_lcu.rst) constructs a BlockEncoding using the Linear Combination of Unitaries approach,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Direct construction via the [BlockEncoding](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/BlockEncoding.rst) class constructor allows you to manually define a new encoding by specifying a ``new_alpha``, ``new_anc_templates``, and a ``new_unitary`` function and returning ``BlockEncoding(new_alpha, new_anc_templates, new_unitary, num_ops=self.num_ops)``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three options are rather self-explanatory, really... You (the user) provide the matrix and/or Hamiltonian you'd like to block encode, or, alternatively, the list of unitaries with the corresponding list of coefficients, invoke the appropriate method for your desired input and, whoosh, Qrisp block encodes it for ya.\n",
    "\n",
    "the Direct construction method is the route for academic with state-of-the-art custom block encodings up their sleeves, catered to the researchers that would like to implement their custom block encodings (and hopefully add them as methods for this class).\n",

Each individual Pauli matrix is a simple $2 \\times 2$ unitary matrix. When you have multiple qubits, you take the tensor product of these matrices. For example, a Pauli string for a 3-qubit system might look like $X \\otimes Z \\otimes I$ (often shortened to $XZI$).

If you can break an operator down into Pauli strings, a quantum computer knows exactly how to execute it.\n",

It simply adds the necessary gates to your circuit to perform the unitary $U$. However, there’s a catch. Because we are block encoding a non-unitary matrix $A$ inside a larger unitary $U$, the \"math\" only works out perfectly when our extra qubits (the ancillas) start in the $\\ket{0}$ state and end in the $\\ket{0}$ state. When you call  [.apply(operand)](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/apply.rst), Qrisp returns a list of these ancilla variables. To get the correct result, you have to perform post-selection. This is a fancy way of saying: \"Run the experiment, measure the ancillas, and if they aren't all zero, throw that result in the trash and try again\". As you can imagine, if your success probability is low, you'll be throwing away a lot of data. It’s effective, but about as efficient as trying to win the lottery by buying one ticket at a time and waiting a week for the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since current quantum hardware often struggles with mid-circuit measurements and real-time feedback (the features required for [RUS](../../../reference/Jasp/Control%20Flow/RUS.rst)), we frequently have to fall back on post-selection. Essentially you run the experiment many times, but you only keep the actors who followed the script perfectly (i.e., the ancillas stayed in $\\ket{0}$). \n",

    "The logic is elegant: by interleaving your block encoding with specific phase shifts, you can apply any polynomial $P(A)$ to your matrix. While finding these \"phase angles\" is usually a classical nightmare, Qrisp calculates them for you internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve distilled these world-class techniques into three simple methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [.poly](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/poly.rst): Apply custom polynomial transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [.inv](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/inv.rst): Perform matrix inversion via approximating by a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [.sim](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/sim.rst): Execute Hamiltonian simulation with optimal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to see the magic? Journey onwards to the next tutorial to continue learning about quantum linear algebra and how Qrisp's BlockEncoding interface makes it simple and intuitive!"
