    "In classical computer science, we often perform operations directly on matrices, such as inversion, exponentiation, or polynomial transformations. In quantum computing, however, all physical operations must be unitary (represented by matrices U such that $U^\\dagger U=\\mathbb{1}$), which means they are reversible and preserve the norm of the state vector.\n",

To solve this, modern quantum algorithms use Block Encodings to \"embed\" these non-unitary matrices into a larger unitary system, and then use Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and its generalizations to manipulate their values. \n",

We essentially put a (possibly) non-unitary matrix in the top left block of a larger, unitary matrix. By projecting onto that top left subspace, we then essentially act exactly with the part of the matrix we wanted to apply, with the rest elements being disregarded.\n",

In the custom block encoding it's rather self apparent: we need three unitaries to construct the Laplacian, as seen above. The ``.from_array`` and ``.from_operator`` methods, on the other hand, construct block encodings by decomposing the Hamiltonian into a linear combination of Pauli strings. If you're asking what is a Pauli string, here's a quick intuitive answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a Pauli string as a multi-qubit instruction. It is a sequence of Pauli operators (matrices) $I$, $X=\\sigma_X$, $Y=\\sigma_Y$, and $Z=\\sigma_Z$. Each individual Pauli matrix is a simple $2 \\times 2$ unitary matrix. When you have multiple qubits, you take the tensor product of these matrices. For example, a Pauli string for a 3-qubit system might look like $X \\otimes Z \\otimes I$ (often shortened to $XZI$). Because Pauli strings are both unitary and Hermitian, they are the \"gold standard\" for quantum hardware. If you can break an operator down into Pauli strings, a quantum computer knows exactly how to execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is exactly what the methods do. It takes an arbitrary square matrix and expresses it as a weighted sum of these Pauli strings ($A=\\sum_j\\alpha_j P_j$), where $\\alpha_j$ is a scalar coefficient (aka a number) and $P_j$ is a Pauli string.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a method like ``.from_array``, the algorithm has no \"intuition\" about the structure of your matrix. It performs a systematic projection of your matrix onto every possible Pauli string. For an $n$-qubit system, there are $4^n$ possible Pauli strings. If your matrix doesn't happen to align perfectly with the Pauli basis, the decomposition results in a massive list of strings, many with tiny coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of our 1D Laplacian, Pauli Decomposition might require up to 16 different Pauli strings to represent the matrix. LCU, on the other hand, requires only 3 custom unitaries (like the ones we manually defined) to represent the exact same matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a block encoding requires a number of \"ancilla\" qubits and gate operations proportional to the number of terms in your sum. The more terms, the more complex the circuit, leading to more noise, requiring more qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having covered the different approaches to constructing block encoding and analysing their quantum resource requirements already sounds extremely useful for (at least) the academics among you who are working on or developing new ways to block encode certain matrices. In that case, performing resource estimation on your approach is incredibly simple (calling ``.resources``) after the approach is implemented in Qrisp. If you'd like some help to implementing your approach, please reach out so that we can include it in future releases. The idea is to have many different methods implemented at one place so that the user can then always use the most efficient one for their problem based on the quantum resources they have at their disposal.\n",

It's impressive to look at, but eventually, you actually want to drive it. In our case, \"driving\" means applying that matrix to a quantum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where ``.apply`` and ``.apply_rus`` come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The manual, NISQy way: ``.apply``\n",
    "The ``.apply`` method is the straightforward way to use your block encoding. It simply adds the necessary gates to your circuit to perform the unitary $U$.However, there’s a catch. Because we are block encoding a non-unitary matrix $A$ inside a larger unitary $U$, the \"math\" only works out perfectly when our extra qubits (the ancillas) start in the $\\ket{0}$ state and end in the $\\ket{0}$ state. When you call .apply(qv), Qrisp returns a list of these ancilla qubits. To get the correct result, you have to perform post-selection. This is a fancy way of saying: \"Run the experiment, measure the ancillas, and if they aren't all zero, throw that result in the trash and try again.\"As you can imagine, if your success probability is low, you'll be throwing away a lot of data. It’s effective, but about as efficient as trying to win the lottery by buying one ticket at a time and waiting a week for the results.\n",

    "A few things to note here. We pass the operand (the state we have prepared and want to apply the LCU protocol to) as a function, as oppossed as a QuantumVariable. The second difference is the way we obtain the BlockEncoding and apply the ``.apply_rus``, which is within a main function. This is because we use the Jasp compilation pipeline, which allows us to avoid the pythonic compilation bottleneck. You can learn more bout it in the Jasp tutorial.\n",

    "By invoking the @terminal_sampling decorator, we sample this probability plenty of times. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, we obtain a result that is consistent when repeating the simulation. This also observed in the variance. We essentially obtain the correct solution all the time with the variance not based on the amount of shots. How neat is that?!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before delving into the final section of this tutorial, let's quickly recap. The ``.apply`` method is great if you are doing complex manual circuit manipulations or if you’re performing resource estimation and don't want the overhead of the RUS loop logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for most \"real-world\" (or real-simulation) use cases, ``.apply_rus`` is your best friend. It takes a function that prepares your qubits (operand_prep) and returns a new function that handles the messy \"measure-reset-repeat\" logic for you.\n",

    "## Expressing new BlockEncodings using arithmetic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, we’ve treated Block Encodings as static objects—you build them, and you apply them. But in the real world (and especially in quantum chemistry or condensed matter physics), operators are rarely solitary. They are sums of interactions, products of symmetries, and scaled potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this, Qrisp allows you to perform a full suite of algebraic operations directly on your BlockEncoding objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addition (``+``): Implements $A + B$ via the LCU framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subtraction (``-``): Implements $A - B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scalar Multiplication (``*``): Scales an operator by a constant $c \\cdot A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Negation (``-A``): Flips the sign of the operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matrix Multiplication (``@``): Composes two operators $A \\cdot B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kronecker Product (``.kron()``): Performs the tensor product $A \\otimes B$ to expand the Hilbert space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will expand this list in future releases, as well as implement more efficient ways for some of these operations. For those curious, we took inspiration from the paper [Products between block-encodings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15779) to implement the underlying logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why and how would this be useful, you might be wondering. Well, if you had to manually track the coefficients, normalization factors ($\\alpha$), and ancilla registers every time you wanted to add two matrices together, you’d probably go back to classical computing by lunchtime. This is where the BlockEncoding arithmetic comes in. In Qrisp, we treat BlockEncoding objects as first-class programming abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: When you write ``x = 1.5 * y + 2.0``, you don't care how the CPU handles floating-point registers or carry bits. You care about the relationship between ``x`` and ``y``.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using standard Python operators (``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``@``) on BlockEncoding objects, you are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automating LCU: Addition and subtraction automatically trigger the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) framework behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Managing Complexity: Qrisp keeps track of the expanding ancilla requirements and the cumulative normalization factor ($\\alpha$) so you don't have to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mirroring the Math: Your code starts looking exactly like the physics paper you're trying to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note of Caution: Just because you can add fifty block encodings together doesn't mean you should. Each arithmetic operation adds circuit depth and ancilla qubits. For complex polynomials, Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) is usually the more efficient path—but (more on that on the other tutorial) for building Hamiltonians, arithmetic is king.\n",

    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "We have journeyed from the mathematical definition of Block Encodings to high-level arithmetic operations on quantum operators. Here is the distilled wisdom from this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Bridge to Unitary: Block Encoding is the essential technique that allows us to run non-unitary math (like Hamiltonians or Laplacians) on unitary quantum hardware by embedding them into larger spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility in Construction: Qrisp meets you where you are. Use ``.from_array`` for quick prototyping, ``.from_operator`` for chemistry/physics Hamiltonians, or ``.from_lcu`` when you need maximum efficiency and custom unitary definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiency Matters: As demonstrated with the Laplacian, choosing the right encoding strategy (LCU vs. Pauli decomposition) can drastically reduce circuit depth and gate count. The ``.resources()`` method is your built-in tool to verify this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deterministic Execution: While ``.apply`` works for NISQ experiments via post-selection, ``.apply_rus`` leverages the Repeat-Until-Success protocol to provide deterministic, Fault-Tolerant compatible execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Composability: You can build complex operators using standard Python math (``+``, ``-``, ``@``, ``*``). Qrisp handles the heavy lifting of managing coefficients and ancilla qubits, letting you focus on the algorithm logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering Block Encodings in Qrisp, you aren't just manipulating matrices; you are structuring quantum algorithms in a way that is modular, scalable, and ready for the future of fault-tolerant computing. Now, go forth and encode!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "MFeeling like you mastered the BlockEncodings class? Good. Now let's use it on some state-of-the-art research applications. In the next tutorial, we move from simple algebra to Quantum Functional Analysis, transforming a matrix’s entire spectrum using Quantum Signal Processing (QSP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard matrix multiplication is expensive. Qubitization bypasses this by using Chebyshev polynomials $T_n(A)$ to \"shape\" your matrix’s eigenvalues with near-zero overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic is elegant: by interleaving your block encoding with specific phase shifts, you can apply any polynomial $P(A)$ to your matrix. While finding these \"phase angles\" is usually a classical nightmare, Qrisp calculates them for you internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve distilled these world-class techniques into three simple methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``.poly``: Apply custom polynomial transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``.inv``: Perform matrix inversion without the LCU headache.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``.sim``: Execute Hamiltonian simulation with optimal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to see the magic? Journey onwards to the next tutorial to continue learning about quantum linear algebra and how Qrisp's BlockEncoding interface makes it simple and intuitive!"
