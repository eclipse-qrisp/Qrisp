    "In classical computer science, we often perform operations directly on matrices, such as inversion, exponentiation, or polynomial transformations. In quantum computing, however, all physical operations must be unitary (represented by matrices U such that $U^\\dagger U=\\mathbb{1}$), which means they are reversible and preserve the norm of the state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most matrices of interest, such as Hamiltonians (which describe system energy), are Hermitian but not unitary. To solve this, modern quantum algorithms use Block Encodings to \"embed\" these non-unitary matrices into a larger unitary system, and then use Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and its generalizations to manipulate their values.\n",
    "## Block encoding 101\n",
    "Block encoding is a foundational technique that allows a quantum computer to represent a general matrix A (where $∥A∥\\leq1$) as the top-left block of a larger unitary matrix U.\n",

    "The Mathematical Definition: A unitary U is an $(\\alpha,m,\\epsilon)$-block-encoding of A if, where $\\alpha$ is a scaling factor, $m$ is the number of ancillary qubits, and $\\epsilon$ is the precision. We essentially put a (possibly) non-unitary matrix in the top left block of a larger, unitary matrix. By projecting onto that top left subspace whe then essentially act exactly with the part of the matrix we wanted to apply, with the rest elements being disregarded.\n",

It's exactly these Chebyshevs that provide an optimal basis for bounded polynomial approximations.
