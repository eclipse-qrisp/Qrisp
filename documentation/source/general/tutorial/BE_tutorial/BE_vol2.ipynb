    "# BlockEncoding class 201: Qubitization, Chebyshev polynomials, QSP\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the tutorial on Quantum Linear Algebra. In the previous tutorial, we learned how to \"embed\" a non-unitary matrix $A$ in the top left block of a larger unitary $U$ using the [BlockEncoding class](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/BlockEncoding.rst). But just having $A$ block encoded usually isn't enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we want to compute functions of that matrix; like $e^{-iAt}$ for simulating dynamics (Hamiltonians), or $A^{-1}$ for solving linear systems, or even applying step functions or Gaussian functions as a filter for ground-state preparation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, to evaluate a complex function $f(x)$, we often approximate $f$ using a polynomial—such as a Taylor series or Chebyshev expansion over a specific domain. In quantum computing, we can perform a similar functional transformation using [Quantum Signal Processing (QSP)](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/115025), which allows us to apply polynomial transformations to the eigenvalues of a quantum operator. We will cover QSP toward the end of this tutorial. To get there, we first need to learn how to use the [BlockEncoding class](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/BlockEncoding.rst) to transform an operator into a \"Quantum Walk\" via Qubitization.\n",
    "\n",
    "After learning about Qubitization, this tutorial will also explain how to block-encode [Chebyshev polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials) and why they are useful. Namely, we'll cover the [quantum Lanczos method](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-05-23-1018/pdf/), a technique that uses the Krylov subspace (built from Chebyshev polynomials) to estimate the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian without needing complex time-evolution. We will also cover the [Childs-Kothari-Somma (CKS) algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02306), which is a near-optimal linear system solver that uses block encoded Chebyshev polynomials in another layer of LCU, this time with a neat (spoiler alert: unary encoding) trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then show how to run the algorithms stemming from [generalized QSP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01501) in Qrisp, and how the [BlockEncoding class](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/BlockEncoding.rst) makes polynomial transformations, solving linear systems, and hamiltonian simulation as simple as calling [.poly(coeffs)](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/poly.rst), [.inv(eps, kappa)](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/inv.rst), and [.sim(t, N)](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/sim.rst) methods respectively.\n",

    "## Qubitization\n",
    "If a Block Encoding is a \"static snapshot\" of a matrix $A$, Qubitization is what makes it \"move\". Technically, Qubitization is a method to transform an $(\\alpha, m, \\epsilon)$-block-encoding of a matrix $A$ into a special unitary operator $W$, often referred to as the \"walk operator\". This operator has a nice property: it maps the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $A$ to the eigenvalues $e^{\\pm i \\arccos(\\lambda/\\alpha)}$ in a set of two-dimensional invariant subspaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a Hermitian matrix $H$ and its block-encoding $(U, G)$, where $G\\ket{0} = \\ket{G}$, we use the definition of the reflection operator $R$ acting on the ancilla space as $R = (2\\ket{G}\\bra{G}_a \\otimes \\mathbb{I}_a)\\otimes \\mathbb{I}_{s}$ from [Lemma 1 in Exact and efficient Lanczos method on a quantum computer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00567). To \"qubitize\" the encoding, we interleave the SELECT operator with this reflection. The Qubitized Walk Operator $W$ is defined as $W = U\\cdot R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rigorous analysis (see [Lin Lin, Chapter 8](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08309)) shows that if $\\ket{\\psi_\\lambda}$ is an eigenvector of $H/\\alpha$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda \\in [-1, 1]$, the walk operator $W$ doesn't wander through the whole Hilbert space. Instead, it acts on an invariant 2D subspace spanned by the \"ideal\" state $\\ket{G}\\ket{\\psi_\\lambda}$ and an orthogonal state. Within this subspace, the eigenvalues of $W$ are $\\mu_\\pm = \\lambda \\pm i\\sqrt{1-\\lambda^2} = e^{\\pm i \\arccos(\\lambda)}$. Essentially, Qubitization \"lifts\" the eigenvalues of our matrix onto the unit circle in the complex plane, allowing us to manipulate them using phase rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems like a mouthful, but in order for this tutorial to cater to both developers coming from the classical domain, as well as researchers in quantum computing, it's the \"necessary evil\". To make it up to you, we're going to show how in Qrisp, you don't need to build these reflections manually. But first, some visual aid so that you see that it's not as complex as it sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Qubitization](qubitization.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial you've already learned how we use the $\\text{SELECT}$ by just calling [q_switch](../../../reference/Primitives/qswitch.rst). Well, what if we told you that performing the reflection operation above you can just use the [reflection](../../../reference/Primitives/reflection.rst) function? And by combining the two you can easily define the qubitization walk operator? Yup, that's the cool thing about modular software development approach Qrisp is taking with its focus on high-level abstractions. Let's get to coding!\n",

    "### Qubitization in Qrisp as [.qubitization()](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/qubitization.rst)\n",
    "\n",
    "While understanding the internal mechanics of [q_switch](../../../reference/Primitives/qswitch.rst) and [reflection](../../../reference/Primitives/reflection.rst) is valuable for intuition, Qrisp abstracts this complexity away for standard operations. The [BlockEncoding class](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/BlockEncoding.rst) features a dedicated method, [.qubitization()](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/qubitization.rst), which automatically constructs the walk operator $W$ from your input matrix. This method handles the heavy lifting: it identifies the necessary reflection operators $R$ and interleaves them with the signal oracle (the block-encoding unitary $U$). If the original block-encoding unitary $U$ isn't Hermitian (i.e., $U^2 \\neq \\mathbb{1}$), Qrisp automatically handles the Hermitian embedding by often requiring one additional ancilla qubit. This is the cost of ensuring the walk operator remains unitary.\n",

    "## Block encoding Chebyshev polynomials\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of Qubitization is its natural relationship with Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, $T_k(x)$, defined as $T_k(\\cos \\theta) = \\cos(k\\theta)$. If we apply the walk operator $W$ $k$-times, the resulting unitary $W^k$ contains $T_k(A/\\alpha)$ block encoded in the top-left block:\n",

    "$$(\\bra{G} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) U (\\ket{G} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) = A/\\alpha.$$\n",
    "We just replaced $U$ with $W^k$. I'm still in awe about how this holds true - it cannot be this simple, right?! Well, based on the theory backing it, it is. Awesome!\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice the term $A/\\alpha$ and wonder where this scaling comes from. In any block encoding, we are embedding a non-unitary matrix $A$ into a larger unitary $U$. Since the eigenvalues of a unitary must lie on the unit circle (norm 1), and the spectral norm of our matrix $A$ might be much larger, we must scale $A$ down.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the LCU framework, if $A = \\sum_i \\alpha_i U_i$, then $\\alpha = \\sum_i |\\alpha_i|$. This $\\alpha$ (often called the \"subnormalization factor\") ensures that the operator $\\|A/\\alpha\\| \\leq 1$, making it mathematically possible to \"fit\" inside a quantum circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But what's so special about Chebyshev polynomials?\", you might be wondering. As noted in Lin Lin’s lecture notes, Chebyshev polynomials are \"optimal\" in two senses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterative Efficiency: Because $W$ is a single unitary, applying $W^k$ requires only $k$ queries to the block encoding. This is much cheaper than the $O(2^n)$ terms often required by naive Taylor series expansions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Approximation Theory: According to the [Chebyshev Equioscillation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equioscillation_theorem), $T_k(x)$ provides the best uniform approximation to a function over the interval $[-1, 1]$. This ensures that our quantum algorithm achieves the desired precision $\\epsilon$ with the minimum possible quantum resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "We think that, again, some visual aid is needed. By applying the walk operator $k$ times, we block encode the $k$-th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind $T_k$. If you apply $W^k=(RU)^k$ $k$ times, you get $T_k(H)$ block encoded. Do it once, $k=1$, you get the top left figure. Do it twice ($k=2$), you block-encode $T_2$ (top right figure).

Instead of evolving the system in time, we use these polynomials to construct a Krylov subspace. This allows us to \"scan\" the spectrum of a Hamiltonian by building the subspace through simple repetitions of the walk operator, rather than complex time-evolution gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it in a more digestible way, the Lanczos method projects the Hamiltonian into a much smaller, manageable subspace. We construct a projected Hamiltonian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ and an overlap matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ within this subspace. The matrix elements are defined as:\n",

    "## Quantum Signal Processing (QSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "While LCU and Qubitization allows us to block-encode operators and Chebyshev polynomials $T_k$; the latter by simply repeating a walk operator $W=RU$, Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) provides a way to implement nearly any arbitrary polynomial transformations $P(A)$. You might wonder: \"Why go through the trouble of encoding a number $x$ into an operator just to evaluate a polynomial? A calculator can do that.\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The power of QSP lies in the fact that $x$ actually represents the eigenvalues of a large, block-encoded operator $A$. By finding a way to transform the scalar $x$, we can simultaneously apply that same transformation to the entire operator $A \\rightarrow P(A)$, a task that is computationally impossible for a classical calculator when $A$ is a $2^n \\times 2^n$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, QSP manipulates a single-qubit \"signal\" using a sequence of rotations. If we have $2\\times 2$ signal operator $W(x)$ that encodes some value $x \\in [-1, 1]$, we interleave it with a series of phase shifts $e^{i\\phi_j Z}$, the resulting product of unitaries can be written as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Specifically, by choosing the phase angles $\\{\\phi_0, \\phi_1, \\dots, \\phi_d\\}$ correctly, the resulting unitary $U_\\Phi$ becomes a new block encoding. In this new encoding, the matrix occupying the top-left block is no longer $A/\\alpha$, but rather a polynomial $P(A/\\alpha)$. In other words, applying QSP to a block encoding returns a new block encoding representing the polynomial of the underlying operator.\n",

    "Through a clever choice of the phase angles $\\{\\phi_0, \\phi_1, \\dots, \\phi_d\\}$, the block-encoding (top left block) of this unitary becomes a polynomial $P(x)$. When we \"lift\" this logic from a single qubit to a full quantum variable this 1-qubit rotation sequence effectively applies the polynomial $P$ to every eigenvalue of your Hamiltonian or matrix at once.\n",

    "The Fundamental Theorem of QSP states that there exists a set of phase angles $\\{\\phi_0, \\dots, \\phi_d\\}$ such that the top-left block of $U_\\Phi$ corresponds to a polynomial $P(A/\\alpha)$ where:\n",

    "Uhm, that's surprising on two accounts?! Firstly, the resources for this seem enormous? And, again, this is expected, because we're (still) trying to invert a dense matrix (same as above). As already mentioned, the exponential quantum speedup comes for some specific, sparse, matrices - this means that they have only a small amount of entries, with all the rest being zero. Remember the Laplacian from the previous tutorial - it's mostly zeroes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second surprise is that gate counts and depth are **almost exactly the same**?! This stems from both having **almost exactly the same** structure of the algorithm (when Qrisp optimizations of the CKS circuit visualized above come into play). The only difference is the amount of qubits! This is also easily explainable: while CKS needs 14 auxiliary qubits (which is understandeable since we're approximating the polynomial of the degree 25: $T_{25}$, which corresponds to 13 odd terms, which also the code above shows (12+1=13)), QET (which leverages the fact of having parity polynomials, resulting in a more efficient circuit) requires **only one**.  Let's check also the quality of the solutions of [.inv(eps, kappa)](../../../reference/Block%20Encodings/methods/inv.rst) and compare to those obtained with CKS:"
