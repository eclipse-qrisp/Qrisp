    "# Part I: From Theory to Code: Constructing a BlockEncoding\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve already delved into the theory of Qubitization and Quantum Signal Processing (GSP/GQSP) in our previous tutorial, you know the drill. If you skipped them because you were eager to see code... no judgment, this is a safe space! Here is all the tl;dr you need to catch up and tag along.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, a block encoding embeds a non-unitary matrix $A$ (which might not even be square) into the top-left corner of a larger unitary matrix $U$. If we can implement $U$, we can \"apply\" $A$ to a quantum state by projecting onto the correct subspace. Mathematically, a unitary $U$ is an $(\\alpha, a, \\epsilon)$-block-encoding of $A$ if:$$\\| A - \\alpha (\\bra{0}^a \\otimes I) U (\\ket{0}^a \\otimes I) \\| \\leq \\epsilon$$ \n",
    "In Qrisp, we turn this mathematical definition into a functional object that you can add, multiply, and transform just like a standard variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it. That's all the theory you need to grasp for you to follow this series showcasing how to, among other things, apply polynomial filtering to get a better idea of the ground state! How cool does that sound! If you'd like to delve deeper into the theory, check out the theoretically more rigorous introduction in the theoretical tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we focus on the \"How.\" You will learn to generate block encodings from various sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constructors: Use ``.from_operator``, ``.from_array``, or the powerful ``.from_LCU`` (Linear Combination of Unitaries).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arithmetic with BlockEncodings: Perform \"Quantum Algebra\" using standard Pythonic syntax. Need to add two matrices? Just use ``A + B``. Want to scale an operator? Boom. ``0.5 * A``. Multiply two block encodings? ``A @ B``... You get the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execution and Quantum Resource Analysis: Move from abstraction to reality. ``.apply()`` automatically synthesizes the gates (no hand weaving circuits, I promise!), handling all ancilla management. For simulation, ``.apply_rus`` invokes a Repeat-Until-Success procedure returning the result only if the all ancillas are measured in $\\ket{0}$. To peek under the hood and see exactly how many gates of all kind, you can use the ``.resources`` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing your first BlockEncoding\n",
    "The BlockEncoding class is designed to meet you wherever you are in your workflow. There are three primary ways to bring an operator into the Qrisp environment: :ref:`.from_array`, :ref:`.from_operator`, and :ref:`.from_LCU`. Let's take a look at how each of them work and how we can use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### :ref:`.from_array`\n",
    "If you are coming from a data science or numerical analysis background, you likely have your data in a matrix. In that case, the :ref:`from_array` is the bridge designed for you. Well as long as the matrix is square and its size $N$ must be a power of two. If this is not the case, fear not, you can always pad the reamaining rows and columns accordingly. The method supports various formats including numpy.ndarray, scipy.sparse.csr_array, and csr_matrix. A quick example would look something like this:\n",
