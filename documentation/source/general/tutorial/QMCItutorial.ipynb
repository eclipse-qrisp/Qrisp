    "## Theory & Implementation in Qrisp\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation in Qrisp requires the implementation of the function acting on a [QuantumFloat](/reference/Quantum%20Types/QuantumFloat.html#quantumfloat). We will see how this can be done later in the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is multiple ways to implement Monte Carlo integration in a quantum fashion. In this tutorial, we use an approach based on quantum counting. The idea is to discretize not only the $x$-axis but the $y$-axis as well. We use two `QuantumFloats` for this. \n",
    "One `QuantumFloat` will hold the discretized values of the $x$-axis, while the other one will hold the discretized values of the $y$-axis. \n",
    "We can then simply count, in quantum fashion, the number of points under the function curve, and divide it by the number of total points. This is enabled by a `QuantumBool` which for each state $\\ket{x}\\ket{y}$ indicates whether the condition $y<f(x)$ is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't give up just yet, the mathematical description will bring you more clarity!\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we consider the situation where $f\\colon [0,1]\\rightarrow[0,C]$ is a bounded continuous function of one variable. The strategy presented below can straightforwardly be generalized to the higher-dimensional case.\n",
    "We wish to evaluate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{0}^{1}f(x)\\mathrm dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This integral is approximated as [Riemann sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{N-1}f(i/N)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, we prepare a uniform superposition state in the `QuantumFloats` (or any other distribution for the variable discretizing the $x$-axis):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{0} \\ket{0} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{M \\cdot N}} \\sum^{N-1}_{i=0} \\sum^{M-1}_{j=0} \\ket{x_i} \\ket{y_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_i=i/N$ and $y=j\\cdot C/M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a second step, we apply the oracle that evaluates the \"points under the curve\" condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{x_i} \\ket{y_j} \\ket{\\text{False}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{1}_{y_j \\geq f(x_i)} \\ket{x_i} \\ket{y_j} \\ket{\\text{False}} + \\mathbb{1}_{y_j < f(x_i)} \\ket{x_i} \\ket{y_j} \\ket{\\text{True}}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "We now arrive at the central step of this algorithm, which is Quantum Amplitude Estimation. We use it to find the probability of measuring a good state $\\ket{x_i}\\ket{y_j}\\ket{\\text{True}}$, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(\\{ (x_i,y_j) \\mid y_j < f(x_i) \\}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum^{N-1}_{i=0} \\frac{1}{M} \\sum^{M-1}_{j=0}  \\mathbb{1}_{y_j < f(x_i)} \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum^{N-1}_{x=0} \\frac{f(x_i)}{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last step, we calculate the ratio between the number of points under the curve and the total number of points $M$ in the interval $[0,C]$. This serves as an approximation for $f(x)/C$.\n",
    "The last expression is then (up to the scaling factor $C$) an approximation for the integral in question. (For more information on why this is the case check out this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral).)"
