    "Quantum computing offers a promising avenue for simulating complex molecular systems, potentially revolutionizing fields like drug discovery, materials science, and chemical engineering. At the heart of this capability lies Hamiltonian simulation, a powerful technique that allows us to model the quantum behavior of molecules with exponentially less resources compared to classical computers. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to simulate molecules using Hamiltonian simulation techniques implemented in Qrisp. Qrisp provides a user-friendly interface for simulating quantum many body systems, making it a suitable tool for tackling complex quantum chemistry problems. We'll cover the following key aspects:\n",

    "## The fundamentals of Hamiltonian simulation and the second quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what \"second quantization\" means it might be helpful to\n",
    "start with the **first quantization**. The idea behind this is that\n",
    "physical systems containing only a single particale are described by a\n",
    "Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$, which consits of a set of basis vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{H} = \\text{span}(\\ket{\\psi_i} \\mid i \\in \\mathcal{N})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An arbitrary state $\\ket{\\phi}$ can therefore be represented by a linear\n",
    "combination of these basis vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\phi} = \\sum_{i = 0}^\\infty a_i \\ket{\\psi_i},\\quad a_i \\in \\mathbb{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What these particular $\\ket{\\psi_i}$ represent depends on the system.\n",
    "For instance for the Hydrogen atom these basis vectors represent the\n",
    "[atomic orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital). If you\n",
    "participated in a course for atomic physics before, you might have seen\n",
    "pictures like this:\n",
