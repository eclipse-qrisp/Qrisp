    "Quantum computing offers a promising avenue for simulating complex molecular systems, potentially revolutionizing fields like drug discovery, materials science, and chemical engineering. At the heart of this capability lies Hamiltonian simulation, a powerful technique that allows us to model the quantum behavior of molecules with exponentially less resources compared to classical computers. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to simulate molecules using Hamiltonian simulation techniques implemented in Qrisp. Since version 0.5, Qrisp provides a user-friendly interface for simulating quantum many body systems, making it a suitable tool for tackling complex quantum chemistry problems. We'll cover the following key aspects:\n",

    "-   The fundamentals of Hamiltonian simulation and the second quantization\n",
    "-   Loading molecular data into Qrisp\n",

    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to\n",
    "leverage Qrisp's capabilities to perform molecular simulations on\n",
    "quantum computers. Let's dive in and discover how Qrisp can help us\n",

    "\n",
    "## The fundamentals of Hamiltonian simulation and the second quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what \"second quantization\" means it might be helpful to\n",
    "start with the **first quantization**. The idea behind this is that\n",
    "physical systems containing only a single particale are described by a\n",
    "Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$, which consits of a set of basis vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{H} = \\text{span}(\\ket{\\psi_i} \\mid i \\in \\mathcal{N})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An arbitrary state $\\ket{\\phi}$ can therefore be represented by a linear\n",
    "combination of these basis vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\phi} = \\sum_{i = 0}^\\infty a_i \\ket{\\psi_i},\\quad a_i \\in \\mathbb{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What these particular $\\ket{\\psi_i}$ represent depends on the system.\n",
    "For instance for the Hydrogen atom these basis vectors represent the\n",
    "[atomic orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital). If you\n",
    "participated in a course for atomic physics before, you might have seen\n",
    "pictures like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.qrisp.eu/_images/hydrogen_with_axes.png\" class=\"align-center\" width=\"400\" alt=\"image\" />\n",

    "vectors (the one with \\$n = 4, k = 3, l = 1\\$ to be precise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **second quantization** now describes how systems including\n",
    "*multiple particles* are treated. For this the so called ladder\n",
    "operators are introduced, that is, for each basis state $\\ket{\\psi_i}$\n",
    "there is an operator $a_i^\\dagger$, which creates a particle in state\n",
    "$\\ket{\\psi_i}$. A creative notation for this might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_i^\\dagger \\ket{\\phi} = \\ket{\\phi \\text{ + a particle in state i}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, this operator is called the \"creator\". Similarly there\n",
    "is also the \"annihilator\" $a_i$, which destroys the particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ladder operators therefore determine the intrinsic interaction\n",
    "behavior of the particles. Observations from experiments show that there\n",
    "are two types of particles whose ladder operators follow different sets\n",
    "of laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **Bosons** the ladder operators obey\n",

    "Note that the fermionic laws imply $a_i^\\dagger a_i^\\dagger = 0$. This\n",
