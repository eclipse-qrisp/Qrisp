Hybrid Control Flow
===================

Due to the Jax embedding, Jasp comes with a matured ecosystem for representing classical computations. To enable a fully hybrid software stack, we need the ability to perform quantum computations based on the results of classical conditions. For this we provide the following interfaces in particular.

* :ref:`ClControlEnvironment <ClControlEnvironment>`
* :ref:`jrange`
* :ref:`prefix_control`
* :ref:`RUS`
