Circuit Construction
====================

The circuit construction module allows the user to implement low level functions to integrate them in routines of higher complexity. For classical languages, this is a `common feature <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_assembler>`_ of many compilers. 
Since :ref:`QuantumSession` is an inheritor of QuantumCircuit, it also exposes an append method, implying that once a QuantumCircuit is created it can be smoothly integrated into Qrisps high-level infrastructure using the :meth:`to_gate <qrisp.QuantumCircuit.to_gate>` method:

::
   
   from qrisp import QuantumCircuit
   from third_party_qiskit_module import some_quantum_function_qc
   
   def some_quantum_function(qv, parameters):
      qc = QuantumCircuit.from_qiskit(some_quantum_function_qc(parameters))
      qv.qs.append(qc.to_gate(), qv)
   

This snippet demonstrates how a Qiskit quantum circuit generated by a third party module can be turned into a Qrisp function of a :ref:`QuantumVariable`.

There are 5 important classes here:

* The :doc:`QuantumCircuit` class, which describes quantum circuits in a very similar way as Qiskit (ie. it contains a list of qubit objects, a list of classical bit objects and a list of instructions)

* The :doc:`Operation` class, which corresponds to the gate object from Qiskit. This class describes arbitrary gates and measurements.

* The :doc:`Instruction` class, which combines Operation objects and the qubit/classical bits it operates on.

* The :doc:`Qubit` class, which represents qubits.

* The :doc:`Clbit` class, which represents classical bits.

.. note::
   In order to allow an easy transition, this module's architecture and naming is close to Qiskit.
