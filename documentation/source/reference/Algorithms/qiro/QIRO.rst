An algorithm to facilitate the functionality of Quantum Informed Recursive Optimizations, as developed by J. Finzgar et. al. in `Quantum-Informed Recursive Optimization Algorithms (2023) <https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.020327>`_ .

It is based on updating the problem instance based on correlations, that are in turn established with a QAOA protocol. For further info have a look at our `tutorial on QIRO <https://www.qrisp.eu/general/tutorial/QIROtutorial.html>`_!

The central data structure of the QIRO module is the :ref:`QIROProblem` class.

:ref:`QIROProblem`
------------------

The :ref:`QIROProblem` encapsulates the required prerequesites to run the algorithm:

* The ``problem`` to be solved, which is not necessarly a graph.
* The ``replacement_routine``, which has the job of performing the aforementioned specific reductions to the ``problem`` object.
* The ``cost_operator``, ``mixer``, ``init_function`` and ``cl_cost_function`` in analogy to :ref:`QAOAProblem` instantiation.
