Shor's algorithm
================

In the realm of quantum computing, where classical limitations are challenged and new horizons are explored, Shor's Algorithm stands as a testament to the transformative potential of quantum mechanics in the field of cryptography. Developed by mathematician Peter Shor in 1994, this groundbreaking algorithm has the power to revolutionize the world of cryptography by efficiently factoring large numbers—once considered an insurmountable task for classical computers.
