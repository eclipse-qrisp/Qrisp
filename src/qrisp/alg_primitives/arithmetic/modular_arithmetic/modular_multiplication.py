# This file implements the techniques described in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01081
# The goal is to have performant modular multiplication. To this end, instead of taking the
# much explored path of creating a modular adder, that is used within the multiplication,
# the paper instead describes multiple techniques to perform the modulo reduction
# after the (non-modular) multiplication has concluded.

# In this file we implement the described techniques for Montgomery reduction.

    This function serves as an example, how classical Montgomery reduction works.

    Note, that the return value is not t%N but (t*2**-m)%N. This is called Montgomery
    form and doesn't really create in any problems because it is just a matter of
    encoding.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t : integer
        The value to be reduced.
    N : integer
        The modulus.
    m : integer
        The Montgomery shift. Needs to satisfy t < N 2**n.

    Returns
    -------
    S : integer
        The result of the reduction: S = (t*2**-m)%N
    u : integer
