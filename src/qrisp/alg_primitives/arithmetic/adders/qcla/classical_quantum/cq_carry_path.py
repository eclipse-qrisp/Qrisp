# This file implements the carry generation art of the algorithm presented here:

# However instead of two quantum inputs, this file deals with the case of one quantum
# and one classical input.

# For two quantum inputs, see qrisp.alg_primitives.arithmetic.adders.qcla.carry_path

# Many functions and ideas are adapted from this file, so to get an understanding
# for this file, we recommend going through the quantum-quantum file first


# We implement the Brent-Kung-Tree in a recursive manner. See:
