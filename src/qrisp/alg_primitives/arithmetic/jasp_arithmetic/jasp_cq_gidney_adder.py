    # If the quantum target only has a single qubit, the addition can be performed

    # The relevant observation to turn Gidney's adder into a semi-classical adder
    # is that the "a_i" qubit (in his paper these qubits are called "i")
    # is only involved in two interactions:
    #   1. The CNOT gate from the ancilla qubit of the previous iteration
    #   2. The the quasi-toffoli gate into the ancilla of the current interaction
    # If we consider "a_i" as a classically known value, we can recover the quantum
    # value of the first step by applying an x gate onto the ancilla of the previous
    # iteration if a_i is True.

    # To "simulate" the quasi-toffoli we then simply use this ancilla as a control
    # value instead.

    # Combining these steps results in a quasi-toffoli with a modified control-state
    # If a is True, the quasi-toffoli receives the flipped value of the ancilla
