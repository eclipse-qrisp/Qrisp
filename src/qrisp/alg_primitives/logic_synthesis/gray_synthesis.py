# The general idea is to apply gray synthesis to the input variable and the output
# variables. The output variable however is enclosed H gates which means that it will be
# |1> if we synthesized the |-> state and |0> if we synthesized the |+> state.
# We choose the phases for the states which have a 0 in the output variable to be 0
# and the phases for the states which have a 1 in the output variable according to
# wether the truth table to be synthesized requires a 1 or a 0.

# An additional perk of this function is, that it support phase tolerant synthesis
# This means that we are tolerant regarding the phase the out will have, i.e. if the
# truth table for a given state says 1 and we activate the phase_tolerant option
# we will get the state exp(i*phi)*|1> so a one but with a phase which might vary
# for different input states. This tolerance regarding the phase allows us to skip half
# of the synthesis procedure making it very cheap regarding the gate count
