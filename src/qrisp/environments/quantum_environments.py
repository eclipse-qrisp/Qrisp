# Abstract class to describe environments
# The idea is to start dumping the circuit data into a container
# (the .env_data attribute) once the environment is entered.
# Meanwhile, the original data of the session is stored in the .original_data attribute.
# The dumping is ended when the environment is left or a child environment is entered.
# The child environment will append itself into the container, once it is left.
# As soon as the most outer environment is left all the circuit data will be compiled.
# The compilation process is specified by the inheritor of this class.
# For instance conditional environments will turn every quantum operation
# that took place in that environment into it's controlled version.

# Another level of complexity is introduced by handling the quantum sessions.
# The problem here is that we want (almost) all quantum sessions,
# that operate inside the environment, to be merged into the environment session.
# The sessions we dont want merged are the ones that get CREATED inside the environment.
# This situtation represents the case that we have a foreign function from a module,
# which creates some gate objects, using a quantum session. If we merge this quantum
# session into our environment, the foreign function no longer works as intended.
# The strategy for solving this kind of problem is now:

# 1. At environment entry, all currently live quantum sessions are logged and the
# environments very own QuantumSession (.env_qs) is created. This QuantumEnvironment
# appends itself to the environment stack of these QuantumSessions.

# 2. Once the append method of a QuantumSession is executed, the environment stack of
# this QuantumSession is checked for Environment where the env_qs QuantumSession
# is not merged into. If this is the case, the QuantumSession's data will be transfered
# into the original_data attribute of the oldest env_qs environment
# that has not been merged into self.

# 3. At environment exit, every quantum session, that operated inside this environment
# is merged together.

# 4. Apart from the (de)allocation gates, all the collected data is stored inside
# the .env_data attribute

    QuantumEnvironments are blocks of code, that undergo some user-specified compilation
    process. They can be entered using the ``with`` statement

    ::

       from qrisp import QuantumEnvironment, QuantumVariable, x

       qv = QuantumVariable(5)

       with QuantumEnvironment():
          x(qv)

    In this case we have no special compilation technique, since the abstract baseclass
    simply returns it's content:

    More advanced environments allow for a large variety of features and can significantly
    simplify code development and maintainance.

    The most important built-in QuantumEnvironments are:

    * :ref:`ConditionEnvironment`

    * :ref:`ControlEnvironment`

    * :ref:`InversionEnvironment`

    * :ref:`GateWrapEnvironment`

    Due to sophisticated condition evaluation of nested :ref:`conditionenvironment` and
    :ref:`controlenvironment`, using QuantumEnvironments even can bring an increase in
    performance, compared to the `control method
    <https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.control.html>`_
    which is commonly implemented by QuantumCircuit-based approaches.

    **Uncomputation within QuantumEnvironments**

    Uncomputation via the :meth:`uncompute <qrisp.QuantumVariable.uncompute>` method is
    possible only if the :ref:`QuantumVariable` has been created within the same or a
    sub-environment:

    ::

        from qrisp import QuantumVariable, QuantumEnvironment, cx

        a = QuantumVariable(1)

        with QuantumEnvironment():

            b = QuantumVariable(1)

            cx(a,b)

            with QuantumEnvironment():

                c = QuantumVariable(1)

                cx(b,c)

            c.uncompute() # works because c was created in a sub environment
            b.uncompute() # works because b was created in the same environment
            # a.uncompute() # doesn't work because a was created outside this
            environment.


    >>> print(a.qs)

    **Visualisation within QuantumEnvironments**

    Calling ``print`` on a :ref:`QuantumSession` inside a QuantumEnvironment will
    display only the instructions, that have been performed within this environment. ::

        from qrisp import x, y, z
        a = QuantumVariable(3)

        x(a[0])

        with QuantumEnvironment():

            y(a[1])

            with QuantumEnvironment():

                z(a[2])

                print(a.qs)

            print(a.qs)

    .. warning::

        Calling ``print`` within a QuantumEnvironment causes all sub environments to be
        compiled. While this doesn't change the semantics of the resulting circuit,
        especially nested :ref:`Condition <conditionenvironment>`- and
        :ref:`ControlEnvironments <controlenvironment>` lose a lot of efficiency if
        compiled prematurely. Therefore, ``print``-calls within QuantumEnvironments are
        usefull for debugging purposes but should be removed, if efficiency is a
        concern.


    **Creating custom QuantumEnvironments**

    More interesting QuantumEnvironments can be created by inheriting and modifying
    the compile method. In the following code snippet, we will demonstrate how to
    set up a QuantumEnvironment, that skips every second instruction. We do this
    by inheriting from the QuantumEnvironment class. This will provide us with
    the necessary attributes for writing the compile method:

    #. ``.env_data``, which is the list of instructions, that have been appended in this
    environment. Note that child environments append themselves in this list upon
    exiting.

    #. ``.env_qs`` which is a QuantumSession, where all QuantumVariables, that operated
    inside this environment, are registered.

    The compile method is then called once all environments of ``.env_qs`` have been
    exited. Note that this doesn't neccessarily imply that all QuantumEnvironments have
    been left. For more information about the interplay between QuantumSessions and
    QuantumEnvironments check the :ref:`session merging <SessionMerging>` documentation.

    ::

       class ExampleEnvironment(QuantumEnvironment):

          def compile(self):

             for i in range(len(self.env_data)):

                #This line makes sure every second instruction is skipped
                if i%2:
                   continue

                instruction = self.env_data[i]

                #If the instruction is an environment, we compile this environment
                if isinstance(instruction, QuantumEnvironment):
                   instruction.compile()
                #Otherwise we append
                else:
                    self.env_qs.append(instruction)

    Check the result: ::

       from qrisp import x, y, z, t, s, h
       qv = QuantumVariable(6)

           x(qv[0])
