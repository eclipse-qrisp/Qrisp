class IterationEnvironment(QuantumEnvironment):
    """
    This QuantumEnvironment can be used for reducing bottlenecks in compilation time.
    Many algorithms such as Grover or QPE require repeated execution of the same
    quantum circuit. When scaling up complex algorithms that perform a lot of
    non-trivial logic many iterations can significantly slow down the compilation
    speed. The ``IterationEnvironment`` remedies this flaw by recording the circuit
    of a single iteration and then duplicating the instructions the required
    amount of times.

    Another bottleneck that can appear is the :meth:`compile <qrisp.QuantumSession.compile>`
    method as the qubit allocation algorithm can also scale bad for really large
    algorithms. For this problem the ``IterationEnvironment`` exposes the ``precompile``
    keyword. Setting this keyword to ``True`` will perform the Qubit allocation algorithm
    on the QuantumEnvironments content and then (if necessary) allocate another
    :ref:`QuantumVariable` to accomodate the workspace qubits of the compilation
    result. This way there is only a single (de)allocation per
    ``IterationEnvironment``.

    .. note::

        Code that is executed within a ``IterationEnvironment`` may not
        :meth:`delete <qrisp.QuantumVariable.delete>`
        previously created ``QuantumVariable`` and every created ``QuantumVariable``
        inside this :ref:`QuantumEnvironment` has to be deleted before exit.

    Parameters
    ----------

    qs : QuantumSession
        The ``QuantumSession`` in which the iterated code should be performed.
        QuantumVariables that have been created outside this ``QuantumEnvironment``
        need to be :ref:`registered <SessionMerging>` in this ``QuantumSession``.
    iteration_amount : integer
        The amount of iterations to perform.
    precompile : bool
        If set to ``True``, the qubit allocation algorithm will be run, once this
        ``QuantumEnvironment`` is compiled. This can significantly reduce the
        workload for a later compile call as there is only a single allocation
        per ``IterationEnvironment`` to handle. The default is False.

    Examples
    --------

    We perform a simple addition circuit multiple times:

    ::

        from qrisp import QuantumFloat, IterationEnvironment

        a = QuantumFloat(5)

        with IterationEnvironment(a.qs, iteration_amount = 10):

            a += 1

    Evaluate the result

    >>> print(a)
    {10: 1.0}

    **Precompilation**

    Squaring a :ref:`QuantumFloat` uses the :meth:`qrisp.sbp_mult` function,
    which has a high demand of ancilla qubits.
    Therefore many iterations can quickly overload the allocation algorithm.

    ::

        def benchmark_function(use_iter_env = False):
            qf = QuantumFloat(5)

            if use_iter_env:

                with IterationEnvironment(qf.qs, 20, precompile = True):

                    temp = qf*qf
                    temp.uncompute()
            else:

                for i in range(20):

                    temp = qf*qf
                    temp.uncompute()

            compiled_qc = qf.qs.compile()


    Benchmark results:

    ::

        import time

        start_time = time.time()
        benchmark_function(False)
        print("Time taken without IterationEnvironment: ", time.time() - start_time)

        start_time = time.time()
