This file implements the tools to perform quantum resource estimation using Jasp
infrastructure. The idea here is to transform the quantum instructions within a
given Jaspr into "counting instructions". That means instead of performing some
quantum gate, we increment an index in an array, which keeps track of how many
instructions of each type have been performed.

To do this, we implement the 

qrisp.jasp.interpreter_tools.interpreters.profiling_interpreter.py

Which handles the transformation logic of the Jaspr.
This file implements the interfaces to evaluating the transformed Jaspr.

    Decorator to determine resources of large scale quantum computations.
    This decorator compiles the given Jasp-compatible function into a classical
    function computing the amount of each gates required. The decorated function
    will return a dictionary containing the operation counts.

    For many algorithms including classical feedback, the result of the
    measurements can heavily influence the required resources. To reflect this,
    users can specify the behavior of measurements during the computation of
    resources. The following strategies are available:

    * ``"0"`` - computes the resource as if measurements always return 0
    * ``"1"`` - computes the resource as if measurements always return 1
    * *callable* - allows the user to specify a random number generator (see examples)

    For more details on how the *callable* option can be used, consult the
    examples section.

    Finally it is also possible to call the Qrisp simulator to determine
    measurement behavior by providing ``sim``. This is of course much less
    scalable but in particular for algorithms involving repeat-until-success
    components, a necessary evil.

    Note that the ``sim`` option might return non-deterministic results, while
    the other methods do.

    .. warning::

        It is currently not possible to estimate programs, which include a
        :ref:`kernelized <quantum_kernel>` function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    meas_behavior : str or callable
        A string or callable indicating the behavior of the ressource computation
        when measurements are performed. Available are


    Returns
    -------
    resource_estimation decorator
        A decorator, producing a function to computed the required resources.

    Examples
    --------

    We compute the resources required to perform a large scale integer multiplication.

    ::

        from qrisp import count_ops, QuantumFloat, measure

        @count_ops(meas_behavior = "0")
        def main(i):

            a = QuantumFloat(i)
            b = QuantumFloat(i)

            c = a*b

            return measure(c)

        print(main(5))
        # {'cx': 506, 'x': 22, 'h': 135, 'measure': 55, '2cx': 2, 's': 45, 't': 90, 't_dg': 90}
        print(main(5000))
        # {'cx': 462552491, 'x': 20002, 'h': 112522500, 'measure': 37517500, '2cx': 2, 's': 37507500, 't': 75015000, 't_dg': 75015000}

    Note that even though the second computation contains more than 800 million gates,
    determining the resources takes less than 200ms, highlighting the scalability
    features of the Jasp infrastructure.

    **Modifying the measurement behavior via a random number generator**

    To specify the behavior, we specify an RNG function (for more details on
    what that means please check the `Jax documentation <https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.random.html>`_.
    This RNG takes as input a "key" and returns a boolean value.
    In this case, the return value will be uniformly distributed among True and False.

    ::


        from jax import random
        import jax.numpy as jnp
        from qrisp import QuantumFloat, measure, control, count_ops, x

        # Returns a uniformly distributed boolean
        def meas_behavior(key):
            return jnp.bool(random.randint(key, (1,), 0,1)[0])

        @count_ops(meas_behavior = meas_behavior)
        def main(i):

            qv = QuantumFloat(2)

            meas_res = measure(qv)

            with control(meas_res == i):
                x(qv)

            return measure(qv)

    This script executes two measurements and based on the measurement outcome
    executes two X gates. We can now execute this resource computation with
    different values of ``i`` to see, which measurements return ``True`` with
    our given random-number generator (recall that this way of specifying the
    measurement behavior is fully deterministic).

    ::

        print(main(0))
        # Yields: {'measure': 4, 'x': 2}
        print(main(1))
        # Yields: {'measure': 4}
        print(main(2))
        # Yields: {'measure': 4}
        print(main(3))
        # Yields: {'measure': 4}

    From this we conclude that our RNG returned 0 for both of the initial
    measurements.

    For some algorithms (such as :ref:`RUS`) sampling the measurement result
    from a simple distribution won't cut it because the required ressource can
    be heavily influenced by measurement outcomes. For this matter it is also
    possible to perform a full simulation. Note that this simulation is no
    longer deterministic.
