# The following function implements the sample feature.

# The basic functionality would be relatively straightforward to implement,
# however there are some complications. The reason for that is that the resulting
# jaxpr should be "readable" by the terminal sampling interpreter.
# Terminal sampling means that instead of performing the simulations "shots"-times
# it is performed once and the shots are then sampled from that distribution.
# Naturally this implies a massive performance increase, which is why a lot
# of effort is spent to realize a smooth implementation.

# The underlying idea to make the feature easily "readable" by the terminal
# sampling interpreter is to structure one iteration of sampling into three
# steps.

# 1. Evaluating the user function, which generates the distribution.
# 2. Sampling from that distribution via the "measure" function.
# 3. Decoding and postprocessing the measurement results.

# For the final two steps we deploy some custom logic to realize the terminal
# sampling behavior. To simplify the automatic processing of these steps,
# we capture each into individual pjit calls.

# The terminal sampling interpreter then identifies each steps via the
# eqn.params["name"] attribute and executes the custom logic.


def sample(state_prep=None, shots=0, post_processor=None):
    r"""
    The ``sample`` function allows to take samples from a state that is specified
    by a preparation procedure. This preparation procedure can be supplied via
    a Python function that returns one or more :ref:`QuantumVariables <QuantumVariable>`.

    The samples are returned in the form of a
    `Jax Array <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.Array.html>`_
    which is shaped according to the ``shots`` parameter. Because of this, shots
    can only be a **static integer** (no dynamic values!). If you want to sample
    with a dynamic shot amount, look into :ref:`expectation_value`.


    Parameters
    ----------
    state_prep : callable
        A function returning one or more :ref:`QuantumVariables <QuantumVariable>`.
        The state from this QuantumVariables will be sampled.
        The state preparation function can only take classical values as arguments.
        This is because a quantum value would need to be copied for each sampling
        iteration, which is prohibited by the no-cloning theorem.
    shots : int
        The amounts of samples to take.
    post_processor : callable, optional
        A function to apply to the samples directly after measuring. By default no post processing is applied.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        Tried to sample with dynamic shots value (static integer required)
    Exception
        Tried to sample from state preparation function taking a quantum value

    Returns
    -------
    callable
        A classical, Jax traceable function returning a jax array containing
        the measurement results of each shot.

    Examples
    --------

    We prepare the state

    .. math::

        \ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\ket{0}\ket{0}\ket{\text{True}} + \ket{k}\ket{k}\ket{\text{True}})\right)

    ::

        from qrisp import *
        from qrisp.jasp import *


        def state_prep(k):
            a = QuantumFloat(4)
            b = QuantumFloat(4)

            qbl = QuantumBool()
            h(qbl)

            with control(qbl[0]):
                a[:] = k

            cx(a, b)

            return a, b

    And subsequently sample from the QuantumFloats:

    ::

        @jaspify
        def main(k):

            sampling_function = sample(state_prep,
                                       shots = 10)

            return sampling_function(k)

        print(main(3))

        # Yields
        # [[3. 3.]
        #  [0. 0.]
        #  [0. 0.]
        #  [3. 3.]
        #  [0. 0.]
        #  [0. 0.]
        #  [3. 3.]
        #  [3. 3.]
        #  [0. 0.]
        #  [0. 0.]]

    To demonstrate the post processing feature, we write a simple post
    processing function:

    ::

        def post_processor(x, y):
            return 2*x + y//2

        @jaspify
        def main(k):

            sampling_function = sample(state_prep,
                                       shots = 10,
                                       post_processor = post_processor)

            return sampling_function(k)

        print(main(4))
        # Yields
        # [10. 10.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0. 10. 10.]
