def qache(*func, **kwargs):
    """
    This decorator allows you to mark a function as "reusable". Reusable here means
    that the jasp expression of this function will be cached and reused in the next
    calls (if the function is called with the same signature).

    A qached function therefore has to be traced by the Python interpreter only once
    and after that the function can be called without any Python-interpreter induced
    delay. This can significantly speed up the compilation process.

    Using the ``qache`` decorator not only improves the compilation speed but also
    enables the compiler to speed up transformation processes.

    .. warning::

        Two important rules apply to the ``qache`` decorator to adhere to the
        functional programming paradigm.

        * It is illegal to have a qached function return a QuantumVariable that has been passed as an argument to the function.
        * It is illegal to modify traced attributes of QuantumVariables that have been passed as an argument to the function.

        See the examples section for representatives of these cases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        The function to be qached.

    Returns
    -------
    qached_function : callable
        A function that will be traced on it's first execution and retrieved from
        the cache in any other call.

    Examples
    --------

    We create a simple function that is qached. To simulate an expensive compilation
    task we insert a ``time.sleep`` command.

    ::

        import time
        from qrisp import *
        from qrisp.jasp import qache

        @qache
        def inner_function(qv):
            h(qv[0])
            cx(qv[0], qv[1])
            res_bl = measure(qv[0])

            # Simulate demanding compilation procedure by calling
            time.sleep(1)

            return res_bl

        def main():
            a = QuantumVariable(2)
            b = QuantumFloat(2)

            bl_0 = inner_function(a)
            bl_1 = inner_function(b)
            bl_2 = inner_function(a)
            bl_3 = inner_function(b)

            return bl_0 & bl_1 & bl_2 & bl_3

        # Measure the time required for tracing
        t0 = time.time()
        jaspr = make_jaspr(main)()
        print(time.time() - t0) # 2.0225703716278076

    Even though ``inner_function`` has been called 4 times, we only see a delay of 2 seconds.
    This is because the function has been called with two different quantum types, implying it
    has been traced twice and recalled from the cache twice. We take a look at the :ref:`jaspr`.

    >>> print(jaspr)
    let inner_function = { lambda ; a:QuantumCircuit b:QubitArray. let
        c:Qubit = jasp.get_qubit b 0
        d:QuantumCircuit = jasp.h a c
        e:Qubit = jasp.get_qubit b 1
        f:QuantumCircuit = jasp.cx d c e
        g:QuantumCircuit h:bool[] = jasp.measure f c
      in (g, h) } in
    let inner_function1 = { lambda ; i:QuantumCircuit j:QubitArray k:i32[] l:bool[]. let
        m:Qubit = jasp.get_qubit j 0
        n:QuantumCircuit = jasp.h i m
        o:Qubit = jasp.get_qubit j 1
        p:QuantumCircuit = jasp.cx n m o
        q:QuantumCircuit r:bool[] = jasp.measure p m
      in (q, r) } in
    { lambda ; s:QuantumCircuit. let
        t:QuantumCircuit u:QubitArray = jasp.create_qubits s 2
        v:QuantumCircuit w:QubitArray = jasp.create_qubits t 2
        x:QuantumCircuit y:bool[] = pjit[name=inner_function jaxpr=inner_function] v
          u
        z:QuantumCircuit ba:bool[] = pjit[name=inner_function jaxpr=inner_function1] x
          w 0 False
        bb:QuantumCircuit bc:bool[] = pjit[name=inner_function jaxpr=inner_function] z
          u
        bd:QuantumCircuit be:bool[] = pjit[
          name=inner_function
          jaxpr=inner_function1
        ] bb w 0 False
        bf:bool[] = and y ba
        bg:bool[] = and bf bc
        bh:bool[] = and bg be
        bi:QuantumCircuit = jasp.reset bd u
        bj:QuantumCircuit = jasp.delete_qubits bi u
      in (bj, bh) }

    As expected, we see three different function definitions:

    * The first one describes ``inner_function`` called with a :ref:`QuantumVariable`. For this kind of signature only the ``QubitArray`` is required.
    * The second one describes ``inner_function`` called with :ref:`QuantumFloat`. Additionally to the ``QubitArray``, the ``.exponent`` and ``.signed`` attribute are also passed to the function.
    * The third function definition is ``outer_function``, which calls the previously defined functions.

    **Illegal functions**

    We will now demonstrate what type of functions can not be qached.

    ::

        @qache
        def inner_function(qv):
            h(qv[0])
            return qv

        @jaspify
        def main():
            qf_0 = QuantumFloat(2)
            qf_1 = inner_function(qf_0)
            return measure(qf_1)

        main()
        # Yields: Exception: Found parameter QuantumVariable within returned results

    ``inner_function`` returns a :ref:`QuantumVariable` that has been passed as an
    argument and can therefore not be qached.

    The second case of an illegal functions is a function that tries to modify
    a traced attribute of a ``QuantumVariable`` that has been passed as an argument.
    A traced attribute is for instance the ``exponent`` attribute of :ref:`QuantumFloat`.

    ::

        @qache
        def inner_function(qf):
            qf.exponent += 1

        @jaspify
        def main():
            qf = QuantumFloat(2)
            inner_function(qf)

        main()
        # Yields: Exception: Found in-place parameter modification of QuantumVariable qf
