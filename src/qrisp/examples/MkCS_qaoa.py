class QuantumColor(QuantumVariable):
    """
    The QuantumColor is a custom QuantumVariable implemented with tackling the Max-k-Colorable-Subgraph problem
    and other coloring optimization problems in mind. It provides flexibility in choosing encoding methods and
    leverages efficient data structures like QuantumArrays to enhance computational performance.

    The QuantumColor class takes as input a list of colors and a flag indicating the preferred encoding
    method - binary or one-hot encoding. The choice of encoding method has implications for how colors are
    represented in the quantum computation.

    In binary encoding, each color is represented by a unique binary number. For instance, if there are four
    colors, Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow, they can be represented, for example, as [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], and [1,1]
    respectively.

    In contrast, one-hot encoding represents each color as an array where only one element is 1 and the rest are 0.
    Using the same four-color example, red can be represented as [1,0,0,0], green as [0,1,0,0], blue as [0,0,1,0],
    and yellow as [0,0,0,1].

    Another key feature of the QuantumColor class is its use of QuantumArrays. QuantumArrays are data structures designed for efficient quantum computation.
    They allow for compact representation and manipulation of quantum states and operators.

    Parameters.
    ----------
    list_of_colors : list
        The list of colors to be used in the quantum coloring problem.
    one_hot_enc : bool, optional
        The flag to indicate whether to use one-hot encoding. If False, binary encoding is used. We use the one-hot encoding by default.

    Attributes
    ----------
    list_of_colors : list
        The list of colors to be used in the quantum coloring problem.
    one_hot_enc : bool
        The indicator which tells the program whether to use one-hot encoding. If False, binary encoding is used.

    decoder(i)
