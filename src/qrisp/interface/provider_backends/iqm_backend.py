    This function instantiates an IQMBackend based on :ref:`VirtualBackend`
    using Qiskit and Qiskit-on-IQM.


    Parameters
    ----------
    api_token : str
        An API token retrieved from the IQM Resonance website or IQM backend.
    device_instance : str
        The device instance of the IQM backend such as ``garnet``.
        For an up-to-date list, see the IQM Resonance website.
        Required if server_url is not provided.
    server_url : str, optional
        The server URL of the IQM backend. If not provided, it defaults to IQM resonance
        using the device_instance. If a server URL is provided, a device instance should not be provided.
    compilation_options: `CircuitCompilationOptions <https://docs.meetiqm.com/iqm-client/api/iqm.iqm_client.models.CircuitCompilationOptions.html>`_.
        An object to specify several options regarding pulse-level compilation.

    Examples
    --------

    We evaluate a :ref:`QuantumFloat` multiplication on the 20-qubit IQM Garnet.
