    """
    Create a pass that recursively decomposes synthesized gates.

    Every gate that has a ``.definition`` (a sub-circuit) is dissolved into
    its constituent elementary gates up to the specified recursion *level*.
    Gates whose definitions themselves contain further synthesized gates are
    expanded deeper with each level increment.

    By default *level* is ``np.inf``, so **all** synthesized gates are
    decomposed all the way down to elementary gates in a single pass.

    Parameters
    ----------
    level : int or float, optional
        Maximum recursion depth for decomposition.  ``0`` leaves the circuit
        unchanged.  ``1`` dissolves one layer of synthesized gates.  Higher
        values expand deeper nested definitions.  The default is ``np.inf``,
        which decomposes all synthesized gates down to elementary gates.
    decompose_predicate : Callable[[Operation], bool], optional
        An optional predicate function that receives each :class:`Operation`
        as its only argument and returns ``True`` if the gate should be
        decomposed.  Gates for which the predicate returns ``False`` are left
        intact even if they have a ``.definition`` and are within the
        recursion *level*.  When ``None`` (the default), all synthesized
        gates are decomposed.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable[[QuantumCircuit], QuantumCircuit]
        A pass function suitable for :meth:`PassManager.add_pass` or
        :meth:`PassManager.__iadd__`.

    Examples
    --------
    Decompose an MCX gate down to elementary gates::

        >>> from qrisp import QuantumCircuit, PassManager
        >>> from qrisp import decompose
        >>> qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
        >>> qc.mcx([0, 1], 2)
