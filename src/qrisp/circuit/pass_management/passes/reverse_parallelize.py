"""Reverse-order parallelization pass.

This pass reverses the instruction order, runs Qrisp's parallelization,
and restores the original order.  It is useful to group commuting gates
with later SWAP operations so cancellation passes can remove redundant
two-qubit gates.

    """This pass leverages permeability commutations to move two qubit gates
    to a later point in the circuit. This is especially helpful when
    trying to cancel out SWAP gates with other two qubit interactions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    qc : QuantumCircuit
        Input quantum circuit.

    Returns
    -------
    QuantumCircuit
        Circuit after reverse-order parallelization.

    Examples
    --------
    We demonstrate how to move a CX gate towards a SWAP.
