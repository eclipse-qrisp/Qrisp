"""
As specified in the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02374), the key challenge
in implementing the quantum backtracking algorithm is the realization of the operators
R_A and R_B. These operators consists of the direct sum of diffuser operators D_x,
where x is an arbitrary node of the backtracking graph.
R_A and R_B are defined as the direct sum of these

R_A = [direct sum] D_x  [summed over all nodes x with even depth]
R_B = |r><r| [direct sum] D_x [summed over all nodes x with even depth]

Or in words: Each node x together with it's children {y : x->y}
defines a subspace H_x = span(|x>, {|y>, x->y}) on which the operator D_x is acting
in-place.

The definition of the D_x operators consists of multiple conditions:

    1. If x is an "accept" node, D_x = 1 (ie. the identity)
    2. If x is the root D_x = 1 - 2|psi_r><psi_r|
        Where |psi_r> = (1+d_r*n)**-0.5 * (|r> + n**0.5 * [sum] |y>)
        Where d_r is  the degree of the root, n is the maximum depth of the tree
        and the sum iterates over all children of r
    3. Otherwise: D_x = 1 - 2 |psi_x><psi_x|
        Where |psi_x> = (d_x)**-0.5 (|x> + [sum] |y>)
        Where d_x is the degree of x and the sum iterates over all children of x

To implement this operator, we will rewrite it a bit:

D_x = 1 - (1+(-1)**accept(x)) * |psi_r><psi_r|

The next step is to assume an operator U_x, which prepares |psi_x> from x

|psi_x> = U_x |x>

We can then write

D_x = D_x = 1 - (1+(-1)**accept(x)) * |psi_r><psi_r|
    = U_x (1 - (1+(-1)**accept(x))*|x><x|) U_x^(-1)

If we pick an encoding, where each node state |x> is a computational basis state,
the center bracket (1 - (1+(-1)**accept(x))*|x><x|) can be realized as a
Z-gate on the bitstring on the
result of accept(x).

Furthermore we need to make sure that only the phase of |x> is flipped. If we simply
apply a Z-gate onto the result of accept, we could also flip the phase of a 
child node y with accept(y) = True. We remedy this problem by determining wether
|x> is odd into a qubit called oddity. For the even diffusing function, this qubit
needs to be in the False state, for the odd function this qubit needs to be in the
True state.

This qubit is then used in a CZ gate.

D_x = U_x CZ(accept(x), oddity(x)) U_x^(-1)

The operator U_x is implemented as the function psi_prep below.

The operator D_x is implemented as the method qstep_diffuser of the
QuantumBacktrackingTree class.

The next layer of complexity is the reject function.
If a node is rejected, it has no children, ie. |psi_x> = |x>.

This could be realized by modifiying the operator U_x but as it turns out there is
a more efficient possibility.

For this consider the fact that for a rejected node

D_x = 1 - 2 |psi_x><psi_x| = 1 - 2 |x><x|

The algorithm will however never evaluate this operator on any of the children of x
so restricted on H_x we can assume

D_x = -1

We therfore now need to modify D_x such that D_x = -1 when reject(x) is True.

To achieve this we deploy a circuit that integrates with our previous construction
but instead performs 

D_x = U_x (-1) U_x^(-1)

if reject(x) = True.

Our goal is therefore now to find some operator O such that

CZ(accept(x), oddity(x)) O(x) = [-1 if reject(x) is True] 
                                        [CZ(accept(x), oddity(x)) if reject(x) is False]
                                        
We conclude that O(reject(x)) needs to flip the phases of all the (pseudo) child states.
(because H_x = span(|x>, {|y>, x->y})).

Similar to the above approach we reuse the oddity qubit to make sure we only operate
on the child states.

Unfortunately we can't assume that the reject function also returns True on the children,
therefore we "lift" the state. This means that we evaluate the reject function on the 
parent. We denote this with the symbol ^.

We conclude:
    
O(x) = CZ(reject(x^), not oddity(x))

To understand how the lifting works, please check the implementation of qstep_diffuser.


This brings us to another important point in the implementation of the algorithm:
The encoding of the node states.

In principle, the paper makes no statement how such an encoding could be realized.
The approach we took here is the following:

A node state |x> is specified by:
    1. A one-hot encoded integer h (for height), which specifies the distance of 
        x from the the steepest leaf.
    2. A QuantumArray branch_qa, which specifies the path to take to reach x.

A few things have to be said about this encoding:

We choose to encoded the height instead of the distance of the root 
(as described in the paper), as this allows straight forward generation of subtrees. 
A node which has height 4 in a some tree T, still has height 4 in a subtree of T.

The initial state of branch_qa is |0>|0>|0>...

Because we use the height instead of the path length, the path to the node is 
specified by the reveresed array. Ie. the path [1,1,0,1]  in a depth 7 tree is 
specified by the branch_qa state

|0>|0>|0>|1>|0>|1>|1>

Any state where there is a non-zero state at an index lower than h is considered
"non-algorithmic", ie. the state does not represent a node. An example could be

h = |4>
branch_qa = |0>|0>|1>|0>|0>|0>
"""


class QuantumBacktrackingTree:
    r"""
    This class describes the central data structure to run backtracking algorithms in
    a quantum setting. `Backtracking algorithms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking>`_
    are a very general class of algorithms which cover many problems of combinatorial
    optimization such as 3-SAT or TSP.

    Backtracking algorithms can be put into a very general form. Given is a maximum
    recursion depth, two functions called ``accept``/``reject`` and the set of
    possible assignments for an iterable x.

    ::

        from problem import accept, reject, max_depth, assignments

        def backtracking(x):

            if accept(x):
                return x

            if reject(x) or len(x) == max_depth:
                return None

            for j in assigments:
                y = list(x)
                y.append(j)
                res = backtracking(y)
                if res is not None:
                    return res


    The power of these algorithms lies in the fact that they can quickly discard
    large parts of the potential solution space by using the reject function to
    cancel the recursion. Compared to an unstructured search, where only the
    accept function is available, this can significantly cut the required resources.

    The quantum algorithm for solving these problems has been
    `proposed by Ashley Montanaro <https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02374>`_ and yields
    a 1 to 1 correspondence between an arbitrary classical backtracking algorithm
    and it's quantum equivalent. The quantum version achieves a quadratic speed up
    over the classical one.

    The algorithm is based on performing quantum phase estimation on a quantum walk
    operator, which traverses the backtracking tree. The core algorithm returns
    "Node exists" if the 0 component of the quantum phase estimation result
    has a higher probability then 3/8 = 0.375.

    Similar to the classical version, for the Qrisp implementation of this quantum
    algorithm, a backtracking problem is specified by a maximum recursion depth
    and two functions, each returning a :ref:`QuantumBool` respectively:

    **accept**: Is the function that returns True, if called on a node, satisfying the
    specifications.

    **reject**: Is the function that returns True, if called on a node, representing a
    branch that should no longer be considered.

    Furthermore required is a :ref:`QuantumVariable` that specifies the branches
    that can be taken by the algorithm at each node.


    **Node encoding**
    
    An important aspect of this algorithm is the node encoding. In Montanaros
    paper a central quantity is the distance from the root $l(x)$. This however
    doesn't generalize well to the specification of subtrees, which is why
    we encode the height of a node. For example in a tree with maximum depth $n$
    a leaf has height 0 and the root has height $n$.
    
    This quantity is encoded as a one-hot integer QuantumVariable, which can be
    found under the attribute ``h``.
    
    To fully identify a node, we also need to specify the path to take starting
    at the root. This path is encoded in a :ref:`QuantumArray`, which can be found
    under the attribute ``branch_qa``. To fit into the setting of height encoding,
    this array contains the reversed path.
    
    We summarize the encoding by giving an example:
        
    In a binary tree with depth 5, the node that has the path from the root [1,1]
    is encoded by

    .. math::
        
        \begin{align}
        \ket{\text{branch_qa}} &= \ket{0}\ket{0}\ket{0}\ket{1}\ket{1}\\
        \ket{\text{h}} &= \ket{3} = \ket{00010}\\
        \ket{x} &= \ket{\text{branch_qa}}\ket{\text{h}}
        \end{align}
    

    **Details on the predicate functions**
    
    The predicate functions ``accept`` and ``reject`` must meet certain conditions
    for the algorithm to function properly:
        
    * Both functions have to return a :ref:`QuantumBool`.
    * Both functions must not change the state of the tree.
    * Both functions must delete/uncompute all temporarily created QuantumVariables.
    * ``accept`` and ``reject`` must never return ``True`` on the same node.
    
    The ``subspace_optimization`` keyword enables a significant optimization of
    the ``quantum_step`` function. This keyword can be set to True if the ``reject``
    function is guaranteed to return the value ``reject(x)`` also on the non-algorithmic
    subspace of x. For instance, if x = [0,0,1] in a depth 4 tree, the encoded state is
    
    .. math::
        
        \begin{align}
        \ket{\text{branch_qa}} &= \ket{0}\ket{1}\ket{0}\ket{0}\\
        \ket{\text{h}} &= \ket{1}\\
        \ket{x} &= \ket{\text{branch_qa}}\ket{\text{h}}
        \end{align}
    
    A state from the non-algorithmic subspace of x is now a state that has non-zero
    entries in ``branch_qa`` at indices less than ``h`` ie.
    
    .. math::
        
        \begin{align}
        \ket{\text{branch_qa}_{NA}} &= \ket{1}\ket{1}\ket{0}\ket{0}\\
        \ket{\text{h}} &= \ket{1}\\
        \ket{\tilde{x}} &= \ket{\text{branch_qa}_{NA}}\ket{\text{h}}
        \end{align}
        
    For the ``subspace_optimization`` to return proper results, the ``reject``
    function must therefore satisfy:
        
    .. math::
        
        \text{reject}(\ket{x}) = \text{reject}(\ket{\tilde{x}})



    .. note::

        Many implementations of backtracking also include the possibility for
        deciding which entries of x to assign based on some user provided heuristic.
        The quantum version also supports this feature, however it is not yet
        implemented in Qrisp.

    Parameters
    ----------

    max_depth : integer
        The depth of the backtracking tree.
    branch_qv : QuantumVariable
        A QuantumVariable representing the possible branches of each node.
    accept : function
        A function taking an instance of QuantumBacktrackingTree and returning
        a QuantumBool, which is ``True``, if called on a satisfying node.
    reject : function
        A function taking an instance of QuantumBacktrackingTree and returning
        a QuantumBool, which is ``True``, if a called on a node where the corresponding
        branch should no longer be investigated.
    subspace_optimization : bool, optional
        If set to ``True``, a significant optimization of the ``quantum_step`` function 
        will be applied. The reject function has to fullfil a certain property
        for this to yield the correct results. Please check the "Details on the
        predicate functions" section for more information. The default is ``False``.


    Attributes
    ----------

    h : :ref:`QuantumFloat`
        A one hot encoded integer representing the height of the node. The root
        has ``h = max_depth``, it's children have ``h = max_depth-1`` etc.
    branch_qa : :ref:`QuantumArray`
        A QuantumArray representing the path from the root to the current node.
        The qtype of this QuantumArray is what is been provided as ``branch_qv``.
        Note that the state of this array is the reversed path, ie. a the node
        with path ``[1,1,0,1]`` in a depth 7 tree has the state:
        $\ket{0}\ket{0}\ket{0}\ket{1}\ket{0}\ket{1}\ket{1}$
        States that have a non-zero value at entries indexed smaller than ``h``,
        are considered non-algorithmic and will never be visited
        (eg. h=3, branch_qa = $\ket{1}\ket{1}\ket{1}\ket{1}$).
    qs : :ref:`QuantumSession`
        The QuantumSession of the backtracking tree.
    max_depth : int
        An integer specifying the maximum depth of each node.


    Examples
    --------

    **Checking for the existence of a solution**

    Even though primary purpose of backtracking algorithms is to find a solution,
    at the core, Montanaros algorithm only determines solution existence. This can
    however still be leveraged into a solution finding algorithm.

    To demonstrate the solution existence functionality, we search the binary
    tree that consists only of nodes with alternating branching.
    We accept if we find the node ``[0,0,1]`` (doesn't exist in this tree).

    For this we first set up the reject condition.

    ::

        from qrisp import *

        @auto_uncompute
        def reject(tree):
            
            oddity = QuantumBool()
            for i in range(tree.h.size):
                if i%2:
                    cx(tree.h[i], oddity)
            
            parity = QuantumBool()
            
            for i in range(tree.branch_qa.size):
                cx(tree.branch_qa[i], parity)
            
            exclude_init = (tree.h < tree.max_depth-1)
                
            return exclude_init & (oddity != parity)

    This function determines first determines the oddity of the height parameter
    (remember ``tree.h`` has one-hot encoding!). Next the parity of the branching 
    path is evaluated. Parity means "is the amount of ones in the path even or odd".
    
    We will reject the node if the oddity of is unequal to the parity and therefore
    reject any path that took a 1 after it already took a 1 (same for 0).
    
    On the root and it's children there will be rejection to allow for two different
    paths.

    We now implement the accept condition:

    ::

        @auto_uncompute
        def accept(tree):
            
            height_condition = (tree.h == 0)
            
            path_condition = QuantumBool()
            mcx(tree.branch_qa[::-1], path_condition, ctrl_state = "001")
        
            return height_condition & path_condition


    Subsequently we set up the class instance:

    ::

        from qrisp.quantum_backtracking import QuantumBacktrackingTree

        tree = QuantumBacktrackingTree(max_depth = 3,
                                       branch_qv = QuantumFloat(1),
                                       accept = accept,
                                       reject = reject)

        tree.init_node([])

    We can evaluate the statevector:

    >>> tree.statevector()
    1.0*|[]>

    The ``[]`` indicates that this is the root state. If the tree was in the state
    of a child of the root (say the one connected to the 1 branch) it would be ``[1]``.

    Note that the ``statevector`` method decodes the QuantumVariables holding the
    node state for convenient readibility. If you want to see the encoded variables
    you can take a look at the :ref:`QuantumSession` s :meth:`statevector method<qrisp.QuantumSession.statevector>`:

    >>> tree.qs.statevector()
    |0>**3*|3>

    We can also visualize the statevector of the tree:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> tree.visualize_statevector()
    >>> plt.show()

    .. image:: ./root_state_plot.png
        :width: 200
        :alt: Root statevector plot
        :align: left

    |
    |
    |
    |
    |

    And finally evaluate the algorithm:

    ::

        qpe_res = tree.estimate_phase(precision = 4)

    Perform a measurement

    >>> mes_res = qpe_res.get_measurement()
    >>> mes_res[0]
    0.1036

    The 0 component has only 10.36% probability of appearing, therefore we can conclude,
    that in the specified tree no such node exists.

    We now perform the same process but with a trivial reject function:

    ::

        def reject(tree):
            return QuantumBool()

        tree = QuantumBacktrackingTree(max_depth = 3,
                                       branch_qv = QuantumFloat(1),
                                       accept = accept,
                                       reject = reject)

        tree.init_node([])

        qpe_res = tree.estimate_phase(precision = 4)


    >>> mes_res = qpe_res.get_measurement()
    >>> mes_res[0]
    0.5039

    We see a probability of more than 50%, implying a solution exists in
    this tree.

    **Finding a solution**

    Montanaros approach to determine a solution is to classically traverse the tree,
    by always picking the child node where the quantum algorithm returns "Node exists".
    Finding a solution can therefore be considered a hybrid algorithm.

    To demonstrate, we search for the node ``[1,1,1]`` with a trivial reject function.

    ::

        @auto_uncompute
        def accept(tree):
            height_condition = (tree.h == tree.max_depth - 3)
            path_condition = QuantumBool()
            mcx(tree.branch_qa[-3:], path_condition)

            return height_condition & path_condition

        def reject(tree):
            return QuantumBool()


    Set up the QuantumBacktrackingTree instance:


    >>> max_depth = 4
    >>> tree = QuantumBacktrackingTree(max_depth,
                                       branch_qv = QuantumFloat(1),
                                       accept = accept,
                                       reject = reject)

    And call the solution finding algorithm:

    >>> tree.find_solution(precision = 5)
    [1, 1, 1]
    
    **Using the subspace_optimization keyword**
    
    To demonstrate the usage of this feature, we create two tree instances - one
    with and one without the optimization.
    
    ::
        
        def accept(tree):
            return QuantumBool()
        
        def reject(tree):
            return QuantumBool()

    >>> opt_tree = QuantumBacktrackingTree(3, branch_qv = QuantumFloat(1), accept = accept, reject = reject, subspace_optimization = True)
    >>> no_opt_tree = QuantumBacktrackingTree(3, branch_qv = QuantumFloat(1), accept = accept, reject = reject, subspace_optimization = False)

    Perform a ``quantum_step`` on both of them:
        
    >>> opt_tree.quantum_step()
    >>> no_opt_tree.quantum_step()
    
    And evaluate some benchmarks:
    
    >>> no_opt_tree.qs.compile().depth()
    89
    >>> no_opt_tree.qs.compile().cnot_count()
    68
    
    With the optimization these values are much better:
        
    >>> opt_tree.qs.compile().depth()
    48
    >>> opt_tree.qs.compile().cnot_count()

        even : bool
            Depending on the parameter, the diffuser acts on the subspaces $\mathcal H_x=\{\ket{x}\}\cup\{\ket{y}\,|\,x\\rightarrow y\}$ where $x$ has odd (``even=False``) or even (``even=True``) height.
            Note that "even" refers to the parity of the ``h`` attribute instead of the distance from the root.
            If the ``max_depth`` of the tree is odd, and ``even=False`` then $R_A$ (otherwise $R_B$) is performed, and vice verse if the ``max_depth`` is even.

        ctrl : List[Qubit], optional
            A list of qubits that allows performant controlling. The default is [].

        Examples
        --------

        Create tree and initialize a node where neither accept nor reject are True.

        We see that the :meth:`quantum step diffuser <qrisp.quantum_backtracking.QuantumBacktrackingTree.qstep_diffuser>`
        moves the state to the children of the [0,0] node (ie. [0,0,0] and [0,0,1]).

        We now investigate how it behaves on nodes that are accepted/rejected:

        Initiate a new tree

        >>> tree = tree.copy()
        >>> tree.init_node([0,1])
        >>> tree.qstep_diffuser(even = False)
        >>> tree.statevector()
        1.0*|[0, 1]>

        As expected, the accepted node is invariant.

        To investigate the rejected node, we create another copy:

        >>> tree = tree.copy()
        >>> tree.init_node([1])
        >>> tree.qstep_diffuser(even = True)
        >>> tree.statevector()
        -1*|[1]>

        As expected, the node has eigenvalue -1.

This function realizes the operator U_x, which has the property

U_x |x> = |psi_x>

For more details on these objects, check the details of the
paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02374)or the beginning of this file.

The general idea to implement this operator are the following two steps:

    1. Manipulatre h such that |h> -> 1/N(|h> + c*|h-1>) with suitable N,c \in R
    2. Manipulate branch_qa controlled on h-1 to bring the new branches into
        into superposition.

The value of the constant c depends on wether x is the root or a terminal node.

For the root c = n**0.5*d_x**0.5
Otherwise c = d_x**0.5

Where d_x is the degree of the node.

"""


def psi_prep(x, even=True, min_height_assumption=0):

    # Determine c
    c = x.degree**0.5

    # The step |h> -> 1/N(|h> + c*|h-1>) will be performed by a ry gate
    phase = np.arctan(c) * 2
    root_phase = np.arctan((c * np.sqrt(x.max_depth))) * 2

    rev_branch_qa = x.branch_qa
    # N = x.max_depth+1
    N = x.max_depth

    # To achieve the first step, we use a circuit, that performs a similar function
    # as a parametrized swap. That means:
    # |00> ==> |00>
    # |01> ==> sin(theta)*|01> + cos(theta)*|10>
    # |10> ==> cos(theta)*|10> + sin(theta)*|01>
    # |11> ==> |11>

    # This way we can "move" the 1 of the one hot encoding up and down.

    # After we moved the one, we apply an H-gate controlled on the target of the
    # moevement, to set up the super position in the branch_qa

    # Furthermore we also need to make sure that non-algorithmic states stay
    # invariant under the U_x (otherwise they will also get tagged in qstep_diffuser).

    # We achieve this by controlling the parameterized swap on the QuantumVariable
