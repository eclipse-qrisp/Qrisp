def solve_QUBO(Q, depth, shots=5000, max_iter=50, backend=None):
    """
    Solves a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).

    This function creates the QAOA problem for a given QUBO.
    It defines a quantum argument as a :ref:`QuantumArray` of ``len(Q)`` :ref:`QuantumVariables <QuantumVariable>` with size 1.
    It then runs the QAOA with the given quantum argument, ``depth`` (number of layers), maximum ``iterations`` of the classical optimizer, and ``shots`` and ``backend`` as measurement keyword arguments.
    The method performs classical post-processing on the solutions of the QAOA optimization:
    it calculates the cost for each such solution, sorts the solutions by their costs in ascending order, and returns the sorted list of solutions.

    .. warning::

        For small QUBO instance the number of ``shots`` typically exceeds the number of possible solutions.
        In this case, even QAOA with ``depth=0``, i.e., sampling from a uniform superposition, may yield the optimal solution as the classical post-processing amounts to brute force search!
        Performance of :meth:`solve_QUBO <qrisp.qaoa.problems.QUBO.solve_QUBO>` for small instance may not be indicative of performance for large instances.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Q : np.array
        QUBO matrix to solve.
    depth : int
        The depth (amount of layers) of the QAOA circuit.
    shots : int
        The number of shots. The default is 5000.
    max_iter : int, optional
        The maximal amount of iterations of the ``COBYLA`` optimizer in the QAOA algorithm.
        The default is 50.
    backend : :ref:`BackendClient`, optional
        The backend to be used for the quantum simulation.
        By default, the Qrisp simulator is used.

    Returns
    -------
    list[tuple]
        A list of tuples representing the solutions: The first element is the cost, the second element is the bitstring, and the thrid element is the probability.
        Solutions are sorted by their costs in ascending order.
