def quantum_counting(qv, oracle, precision):
    """
    This algorithm estimates the amount of solutions for a given Grover oracle.

    Parameters
    ----------
    qv : QuantumVariable
        The QuantumVariable on which to evaluate.
    oracle : function
        The oracle function.
    precision : int
        The precision to perform the quantum phase estimation with.

    Returns
    -------
    M : float
        An estimate of the amount of solutions.

    Examples
    --------

    We create an oracle, which performs a simple phase flip on the last qubit. ::

        from qrisp import quantum_counting, z, QuantumVariable

        def oracle(qv):
            z(qv[-1])


    We expect half of the state-space of the input to be a solution.

    For 3 qubits, the state space is $2^3 = 8$ dimensional.

    >>> quantum_counting(QuantumVariable(3), oracle, 3)
    3.999999999999999

    For 4 qubits, the state space is $2^4 = 16$ dimensional.

    >>> quantum_counting(QuantumVariable(4), oracle, 3)
    7.999999999999998
